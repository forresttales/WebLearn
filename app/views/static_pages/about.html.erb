We are an intermediary between schools and high tech companies, offering unique executive events and publications.

 	As the media, we seek to bring perspective and online resources for everyone in the fray, from school seekers-of-resources to industry partners in need of services. 
 </p>
 <p>
  	With Knowstory, we are building an agnostic sharing and recommendations platform to help schools with needed discovery and analysis related to digital content and curriculum. 
 </p>
 <p>
  	Schools and districts work with the Learning Counsel to help them make the transition to digital curriculum, take inventory, get awareness of new resources, and write their goals and policies.  
</p>
<p>
	Based in Sacramento, California, The Learning Counsel has staff and an extended family of contributors across the U.S. and in the Ukraine.
