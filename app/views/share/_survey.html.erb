			<h1>TAKE THE SURVEY.<br/>HELP YOUR DISTRICT.</h1>

			<p>Our survey instrument will help you know where
you stand. Just by virtue of what questions we are
asking, you will find out more of what others are
doing, and what you are already engaged in that
puts you well on the way to a great strategy.</p>

<p>Our initial surveys, and our city-by-city tour of
Digital Curriculum Strategy Discussions, is proving
to us that many districts and schools just do not
have comprehensive strategies and are randomly
using various hardware products, subscription
sites, apps, digital content and systems. Coupled
with no equivalent shift in how these digital
“things” are vetted, purchased or used, teachers
are literally overwhelmed at a time when standards
and testing are also changing. This is creating an
enormous burden for schools – and a time for
leadership. This Survey will cause your district
to take inventory and really look at what you are
doing from a pedagogy viewpoint. Perhaps you
are over-duplicating digital materials or have no
coverage at all in other subject areas. Inspecting
your policies, methods of purchase and use will
be a healthy exercise that can greatly benefit your
district’s transition with digital curriculum.</p>
