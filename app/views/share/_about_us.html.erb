    <strong>Our Mission: Research and Context on the Shift to Digital Curriculum.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Learning Counsel helps education professionals in the K12 and Higher Ed sectors gain context on the shift to digital curriculum. The more than $15
    Billion curriculum industry across K12 and Higher Ed is in transition, maneuvering through the intersection of policy, technology leadership, old habits
    and new enthusiasms. The Learning Counsel seeks to bring consulting and online resources for everyone in the fray, from school seekers-of-resources to
    industry partners in need of services. We are building an agnostic sharing and recommendations platform to advise schools on all things related to digital
    content and curriculum. Based in Sacramento, California, The Learning Counsel has staff and an extended family of contributors across the U.S. and in the
    Ukraine.
