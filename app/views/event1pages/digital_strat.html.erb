                  <p>The Learning Counsel specializes in leading the leaders, providing perspective and organizational tools on the transition to digital. The 2014 event tour was truly magical, drawing 2-4 times the audience size originally planned and causing the Learning Counsel community to expand to 48,000+ along the way. The unique help provided drew two states to offer support for the events with continuing education credits for attending executives.</p>
                  <h3 class="ds-h3">Why Attend?</h3>
                  <p>Tons of organizations focus on professional development for teachers, but what about professional development for organizations? For Leaders?</p>
                  <br/>
                  <p>We’ve said it before and we will say it again, schools are in the eye of a “perfect storm” of transitioning to digital curriculum. Strategy, and not mere tactics, is so important.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <p>As a leader, you should attend:</p>
                  <br/>
                  <div class="main-left-list">
                     <ul>
                        <li><span>To network with peers.</span></li>
                        <li><span>To learn about, see and discuss the digital transition.</span></li>
                        <li><span>To be a part of this “living tour” crisscrossing the United States bringing best practices information from other parts of the country.</span></li>
                        <li><span>To build your school or district into a model of digital transition, going from strategy to tactics to sustainability to design to experience -- the path the Learning Counsel is helping schools go down and learn from each other about.</span></li>
                        <li><span>To make sure your school or district is not left behind.</span></li>
                     </ul>
                  </div>
                  <p>In 2014 we started with discussions with some short discussions about using an administrative scale to lead forth, and how to use that. We learned a lot about what was in place in schools for leadership and what was missing. We also built a digital curriculum strategy model architecture, whose pieces were taken from the ongoing conversations city-by-city. For 2015, we will continue this “living tour,” learning and sharing with all.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <p>Equity in education is a very important consideration, and the expectation by most parents and students today is digital.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <p>The very real storm of change includes the fact that the traditional mode of curriculum acquisition has fractured as the industry has built up from a handful of major publishers to thousands in a few short years. By survey, teachers are spending upwards of five hours a week just trying to find content to fit the additional changes in standards and testing. In the meantime, technology and digital content collections are advancing at a rapid rate into realms that individual teachers can’t hope to keep up with.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <p>It’s time to talk about this – and lead.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <p>The Digital Curriculum Strategy Discussion meetings bring together interested district executives to discuss real strategy points, tactics and more.</p>
                  <br/>
                  <p>Highlights of a Digital Curriculum Strategy Discussion meeting include:</p>
