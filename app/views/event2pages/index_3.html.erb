            <h3>About the Event</h3>
            <p>The first day will be a historic and educational group
excursion and then a group dinner. Over dinner, we
will discuss how the excursion into the past at historic
New Orleans area plantations affected us, and how the
past practices in schools have been shaping current
practices with digital curriculum—and what needs to
change.</p>
            <p>Day two will feature discussions shaping the future.
Topics hour-by-hour will be about new file standards,
transitioning to digital curriculum and the by-orbuild
issue, professional development changes, policy
issues, and the impacts of tech choices on curriculum
flexibility. Innovative and award-winning leaders from
Houston, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Memphis will be
on hand to lead these key discussions.</p>

            <p>We’ve also invited two special guest speakers to-beannounced
on topics that are very timely nationally.</p>
            <p>The day ends with an Awards Reception for the winners
of the annual Digital Curriculum Strategy Award.</p>
