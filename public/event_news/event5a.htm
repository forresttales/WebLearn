    Over three hundred educators from all levels and across the US meet in Denver for the first ever Colorado Blended and Online Learning “Flipped” Conference 2015
</p>
<p>
<strong>Denver, Colorado:</strong>  On February 19, 2015 over three-hundred education leaders, school and system technology directors and teachers converged at Aurora Public Schools Professional Learning and Conference Center in Aurora, Colorado. The Colorado Blended and Online Learning “Flipped” conference was unlike anything ever produced for the education industry—it was custom designed to fit a lot of PD and experience into one single day.
</p>
<p>
As a “flipped” event, it was uniquely designed to give all attendees an experience similar to that of the flipped-classroom ideal. It began with a key-note from Susan Patrick, the President and CEO of the International Association for K-12 Online Learning (iNACOL). The conference then broke into four “tracks” with each track having a goal and each a learning objective. For many of the sessions opened with a review of their “pre-study” of what the track leaders were presenting, lending to much more depth to discussions, and solutions to digital curriculum transition and blended strategies.
</p>
<p> 
“Our goals for the conference were clearly achieved, stated Judy Perez-Bauernschmidt, Executive Director of the Colorado e-Learning Collaborative. “We envisioned this conference as something new and envelope pushing,” she continued. “Between the Learning Counsel and ourselves, we weren’t sure what to expect. But it surpassed all our expectations!” 
</p>
<p>
With four tracks, sixteen different speakers, two educator/teacher panels and one student panel it was stated by many that it seemed like a week of discussions and inspection of strategies for transition to digital curriculum but condensed all into a single day.
</p>
<p> 
In the words of the Director, School Innovation at State of New Jersey Department of Education, Takecia Saylor, “You felt that you were surrounded with like minds, learning what is happening across the innovative landscape that is education in this time of online and blended learning.” She continued, “I saw the great ways we can bring education leaders and vendors together to share information, interact and get onto the same page in this transition.”
