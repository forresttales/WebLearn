<br>
<p>
    <strong>On April 2nd, 2014,</strong> 23 executives from Fresno and Madera public and private schools and the Fresno County Office of Education met at the Fresno Radisson
    for a day of discussion about digital curriculum transition.
</p>
<p>
    School representing over 153,000 students in Fresno and Madera were at one of two stages:
</p>
<ol class="a">
	<li>
		<p>
		    Years into their 1-1 strategies although not necessarily 100% deployed to all students.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Just beginning a strategy for digital devices and curriculum.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>Kicking Off the Day</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Dr. David Kafitz of the Learning Counsel started the day with a discussion about the future, what schools need to plan toward. Dr. Kafitz primarily pointed
    out that the environment of education is not in sync with the dramatic shift across the greater consumer market. The number of devices people use today,
    where they use them, and what’s predicted for the future were discussed.
</p>
<p>
    The group took an instant survey, responding by texting a code from their mobile devices. Responses to where not what you might expect.
</p>
<p>
    Joe Casarez, Associate Superintendent of Coalinga-Huron ISD commented that, “There is definitely lots of device use and it’s getting to be 100% of the time
    (that people are using them.) What we’re thinking of is how we can maximize students’ time on the bus. They can be on the bus for an hour or more, and how
    do we make it so they can do homework and activities and use that hour.”
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Kafitz also challenged the group to think about how the digital transition would look for them.
</p>
<p>
    “Eventually we want to get to the point where we can differentiate and personalize the learning and in a way that we can’t do it with the old textbook and
    paper means. We do want a blended environment, not entirely digital, but using teachers in a different way,” said Melanie Lewis, Coordinator of Learning
    Resources of Golden Valley USD.
</p>
<p>
    “I would like to comment on virtual education in that Google recently bought “Glass” because they see that as the future. We probably need to think about
    that as how kids will be interacting – that and the headphones – and then actually trying to get their attention will be at a whole different level,” said
    Kurt Madden, Chief Technology Officer of Fresno USD.
</p>
<p>
    Janet Grossnicklaus, Director of Curriculum, Instruction and Assessment of Madera USD commented that in her district, “We need to know how to define the
    path for the individual student.”
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Kafitz also talked about the bandwidth projections as to how those will change once kids are landing on networks with three or more devices in schools.
    Then the conversation turned to storage, and what schools are doing with all the different types of curriculum and subscription sites in terms of managing
    them.
</p>
<p>
    “We have all kinds of cloud services and with the 35,0000 district-owned devices and another 40,000 non-district owned, we find we are finding that Pandora
    is huge, videos are huge, many of which are for education and many are not,” said Kurt Madden. “In terms of storage, it’s going to be like herding cats. We
    can’t really control it, although we could encourage direction like a local cloud.”
</p>
<p>
    Larry Rego, IT Director of Hilmar USD said, “We’ve sort of planned around Google Apps for storage and apps. We can encourage but not really control. We can
    give a sort of ‘Look, here’s the infrastructure and some commonality’ message to our users. We already have to teach copyright law event at the student
    level.”
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Kafitz also discussed what it is taking in terms of time and effort in schools to transition teachers to using more or all-digital curriculum
    resources.
</p>
<p>
    “We’ve been doing professional development around even the Apple 2 since 1976, but a lot of it’s not successful. Even Randi Weingarten, the President of
    the American Federation of Teachers said it’s the #1 issue for the transition, professional learning, but I mean, really? After 30 years of PD, teachers
    still need PD to be able to use technology?” commented Kurt Madden to chuckles from the audience.
</p>
<p>
    Melanie Lewis said, “We need to personalize for teachers, do 1-1 coaching, etc. That’s what it’s really all about.”
</p>
<p>
    “Really, teachers will bring in other teachers to do more sharing. Our problem is that we really can’t break the mold, we really can’t get teachers to
    change from the ‘way it’s always been done’,” said Drew Sylvia, Director of Alternative Education of Selma USD.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Kafitz also discussed how there have been market conversations about providing “badges” instead of grading. It’s all part of a sorting by levels.
</p>
<p>
    Joe Casarez said, “On badging, I am sort of scared of that because I think there needs to be follow up on whether they actually can do the work and apply
    it.”
</p>
<p>
    “We don’t think there is any problem in sorting our kid’s ability levels in physical education, but we’re reluctant to do that in the classroom,” observed
    Sean Ryan, Senior Vice President of Sales of McGraw-Hill Education.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Kafitz said “Maybe the future is to let kids run themselves and just grow, maybe that is what new digital curriculum could do.”
</p>
<p>
    Amy Callahan, of MyON presented and had people discussing adaptive and blended learning with a unique exercise that had the whole group formed into smaller
    groups to discuss. “Students don’t read because books are too hard or too easy, so how can you find the right level by student? MyOn has individual student
    “backpacks” after an interest and lexile test so they are put into the right level,” she said.
</p>
<p>
    Andres Gorbea, California Account Executive from Compass Learning presented. He said, “You need to not just plop down another ebook, but give teachers
    flexible options that are incorporated into an overall strategy. Let’s talk about personalized learning and what teacher behaviors you want to change so
    that you arrive at personalized learning.”
</p>
<p>
    He went on to discuss how Compass Learning “chunks” their materials so that it can be overseen by teachers but still be inclusive of the whole knowledge
    need. He also asked the group if they knew what it really means to be aligned to common core. He said, “We had to ask ourselves what that means, and we
    answered it with it means that the teacher has something to teach with in that common core requirement. When we first looked, we had gaps, but we filled
    them quickly. We used a ‘critical mistakes framework’ which uses ‘distractor rationale’ so that the gaps in a student’s knowledge or a misconception can be
    rectified and the student put on track.” Diagonistics and re-teaching, the data driven instruction at Compass Learning was based on asking teachers what’s
    the biggest barrier they have for data driven instruction, which is time.
</p>
<p>
    Sarah Addison, English Language Learning Coordinator of Kepler School asked “What do you have for reliability measures?” Compass’ Gorbea answered and also
    commented that they are moving all their programs to HTML 5, to ensure their system works across all devices and platforms whether a laptop, a tablet, or a
    mobile device.
</p>
<p>
    David Bezzant, Senior Director of T- Mobile presented and talked about a district in Minnesota that had a view of being device agnostic. He said they were
    more worried about how to make it all function together and make sure the network bandwidth was enough. He talked about a unique T-Mobile offering and
    helping with the “unboxing” and roll-outs. He said, “We have to consider with our school customers what the refresh cycle for their devices is going to be,
    just like with phones. It is actually usually uniquely different in elementary than for high schools.”
</p>
<p>
    Over the lunch workshop, one of the questions Dr. Kafitz asked the group to consider was what their “myths” were with regards to adoption of devices and
    digital curriculum.
</p>
<p>
    Joe Casarez said, “We are in planning toward a new LMS, but one myth we have is that devices will be stolen or there will be an opportunity for crime
    because of them.”
</p>
<p>
    Rich Harmon, Education Technology Coach of Madera USD said, “Really, we see adoption being driven by infrastructure bandwidth.”
</p>
<p>
    Ernie Delgado, Co-CEO at BeyondTechEd, spoke briefly during the workshop. He said, “In schools you have two different camps usually – the appsy-gamesy camp
    of the market, and the other camp is more project-based learning, more productivity tools. That side is more professional development intensive, and
    probably better at teaching kids how to use tools to accomplish some end.”
</p>
<p>
    “And right now, schools shouldn’t abandon project-based learning and personalized learning because the students need those skills for the future of the
    workforce. People still need to be able to use computers, not just tablets, and that requires more training for students and teachers,” said Ernie Delgado.
</p>
<p>
    Joe Casarez said, “What we’ve done right is that we’ve done in classroom training for better professional development outcomes. For example, one teacher
    didn’t know how to flip the teaching so that students were using their devices (with the projection equipment.)”
</p>
<p>
    Andres Gorbea said, “There has to be alignment to adult learning principals and context.”
</p>
<p>
    “What we find is districts want coaching opportunities, not professional development trainings. They want to be helped. We tell schools they need a sort of
    teacher/librarian coach,” said Mark Archon, Director of Instructional Technology Services, Fresno County Office of Education.
</p>
<p>
    Sean Ryan co-presented with Tamara Childress, Technology &amp; Professional Development Manager of McGraw-Hill Education. One of the things he talked about
    was how McGraw-Hill reinvented itself to go more digital, including making major acquisitions and restructuring.
</p>
<p>
    “Digital transition is a process, not an event,” said Tamara Childress. She showed a word cloud made up of the Common Core Standards and word use in
    reference to those. Surprisingly, the two most prominent words were “using” and “technology.” She talked about how the Connect-Ed platform showed a view of
    each teacher’s bookbag. “It’s set up so it’s got differentiated instruction by student for the teachers. A full assessment system sits (alongside it) and
    everything is in one place in the cloud.”
</p>
<p>
    Tamara also mentioned the California specific <a href="http://www.cde.ca.gov/eo/ce/wc/wmslawsuit.asp">Williams Law</a> with regards to student access to materials and that the McGraw-Hill materials allow for kids to
    do homework off-line after downloading and then syncing when they are back on campus – just in case they do not have internet access at home.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Panel Discussion</strong>
</p>
<p>
    At the end of the day, the Panel was led by David Bezzant of T-Mobile and included Melanie Lewis, Coordinator of Learning Resources from Golden Valley USD;
    Kurt Madden, Chief Technology Officer from Fresno USD; Dan Resciniti, Chief Technology Officer of Clovis USD; and Edward Gonzalez, Superintendent of Madera
    USD.
</p>
<p>
    David led with asking the panelists what they liked or did not like about their 1-1 initiatives.
</p>
<p>
    Melanie Lewis said, “We do have a 1-1 initiative, but one thing I learned from studying failures is the fact that real planning and understanding your
    pedagogy is important.
</p>
<p>
    Kurt Madden said, “It gets back to the curriculum and the student learning. I’m a big fan of blended learning and having kids really do something with the
    devices that matters.”
</p>
<p>
    “A personal trainer is someone you pay to do what you could do on your own, but you won’t – which is what teachers need in a blended environment. A coach,”
    said Kurt.
</p>
<p>
    Dan Resciniti said, “Challenges in 1-1 devices are that building up of the infrastructure and planning for that.”
</p>
<p>
    David Bezzant also asked, “What have the challenges been in the curriculum?”
</p>
<p>
    “We got teachers the devices to take home over the summer and then did two months of professional development after they got back, and then teachers were a
    little more comfortable with devices there in the classroom. Students now have devices and so the next thing we did was give the teachers the idea of what
    we were expecting to see in their classrooms, including how we wanted to see it. Then we started providing coaching (toward that,)” said Melanie Lewis.
</p>
<p>
    Kurt Madden said, “The hardest part is really a culture shift. This will take you a few years to get this shift all the way. I think our window of
    opportunity is only a few years.” He also mentioned how colleges are already somewhat on their way.
</p>
<p>
    “For me, it’s really been on the infrastructure side, to be able to provide the collaboration and get people out to the internet, etc,” said Dan Resciniti.
</p>
<p>
    Edward Gonzalez said, “I think from the instructional side, the teaching/learning paradigm has shifted, but really it hasn’t for all. The teacher really
    should, as they always have, make themselves progressively more obsolete so that the student realizes they can do and use the tools and know and learn.
    Teachers have to be willing to be taught themselves, and learn sometimes from the digital natives. Really, teachers need to learn that lesson.”
</p>
<p>
    David Bezzant mentioned a 4th grader who wrote her own app and the school she was going to picked it up and started to use it for all.
</p>
<p>
    “Learning is a two-way conversation,” said Edward Gonzalez.
</p>
<p>
    David Bezzant said, laughingly, “Well sometimes people and kids especially won’t look you in the eye because they are looking down at their device. How do
    you see this change yourself? I mean, it’s a big difference from the days of the card catalog to Google searches.”
</p>
<p>
    Melanie Lewis said, “Yes, there’s a difference between the card catalog and Google, with the card catalog things were vetted and evaluated. So now we have
    to put digital citizenship in the curriculum, and appropriate use policies. What I like is that this gives students more importance in collaboration and
    enhanced interaction with teachers.”
</p>
<p>
    “Students are absolutely more engaged with the learning but I don’t know if that’s as much more engagement with the teacher,” said Kurt Madden. “But now
    here, there’s a lot of ideas going so I’m much more engaged. I’m interested in the same things we all are, like gamification, but here in schools your
    tests and two weeks later you find out how you did. But sometimes kids are at home learning, googling for whatever and learning from that and not needing
    any coaching.”
</p>
<p>
    Dan Resciniti said, “I think it really depends on the teacher. A lot of its enhanced, but the teacher has to effectively use it.”
</p>
<p>
    “I went to see my aging parents last night, and one thing that happened is, if you still have parents, they get bored. When I (showed them a tablet and how
    to use it to look up their interests), like my Mom’s favorite, Graceland and anything to do with Elvis Presley, she was engaged. I also showed them out to
    take pictures. Really, the cure for boredom is curiosity, which has no cure. It’s not the people who have to change, the world has changed around them, and
    it’s hard to accept that the teachers not a repository for information like they used to be. My experience has been that a teacher will change when it’s
    safe for them to do it,” said Edward Gonzalez.
</p>
<p>
    David Bezzant next asked about what percentage of students interacted with devices every day, if it’s 20% of the day or 100% of the day.
</p>
<p>
    Melanie Lewis said, “Well, 100% are using it every day – in at least one course. We will expand more next year.”
</p>
<p>
    “We have spots of excellence. With 3200 classrooms where kids use devices every day, using tech, I’d say it’s about 30-40% (of the total time) every week
    consistently. There is room to grow,” said Kurt Madden.
</p>
<p>
    Dan Resciniti said, “100% of English academics and 6,000 total of 40,000 students have devices.”
</p>
<p>
    Edward Gonzalez asked Rich Harmon his thoughts on this question, and Rich said, “We have done some 1-1 and three or four teachers are using it, but not all
    the time. Some are ‘diamonds,’ but few and far between in practice.”
</p>
<p>
    “It’s important to play ahead for eRate. We’re going to put all 40,000 students in that plan, trying to get funding in Priority One,” said Dan Resciniti.
</p>
<p>
    David Bezzant said, “And you’ll probably get it. There is $4.7 Billion in eRate, although there’s a fear around eRate on it being not sustainable.” He
    mentioned that districts can work through <a href="http://www.micta.org/">MICTA</a> for blanket form 470’s filed through them. He also said that, “Right now, eRate only is for on-campus
    access. Off campus is not allowed (because of some fear that there will be inappropriate use at home.”
</p>
<p>
    Kurt Madden said, to much laughter afterward, “Like they (students) never us it on campus inappropriately.”
</p>
<p>
    Melanie Lewis said, “We need offline work capability because we don’t qualify for a lot of eRate. We tell teachers not to assign homework that requires
    online.”
</p>
<p>
    “What we’re finding more and more is that true digital content can be much more adaptive to student’s needs, but only when it’s truly digital, not a pdf
    with links, etc.,” said Kurt Madden.
</p>
<p>
    “We have a lot of products (digital curriculum), and we have a policy that people have to come and get it ‘approved,’ but it’s really helpful it its LDAP
    compatible so we can implement and manage it. We’re already overwhelmed with password management for teachers. We don’t need to worry about 40,000 kids,
    too,” said Dan Resciniti.
</p>
<p>
    Melanie Lewis said, “We have some English curriculum online. One issue is how quick we can access a system online. The log-ins take too long. This effects
    how much it will be utilized and it is and issue.”
</p>
<p>
    From the audience, Irene Strayer, Account General Manager from Pearson spoke up and said, “What we find is that it takes up to eight years for the adoption
    cycle by the State, which is inhibitive for publishers to address those concerns.”
</p>
<p>
    Edward Gonzalez said, “We have talked about how current events and the like could be used, like the recently disappeared plane and the “ring of fire” of
    earthquakes and tremors in Peru, how those could be used to teach physics today, to create sort of instantaneously relevant teaching to link students to
    their world. (These are new curriculum things, more current.)”
</p>
<p>
    David Bezzant mentioned Alcatel-Lucent’s new software which allows teachers to see what devices are doing in their class.
</p>
<p>
    Dan Resciniti said, “We do have (also) active response in the classes.”
</p>
<p>
    An audience member asked about schools standardizing on one device.
</p>
<p>
    “I do agree that there is more opportunity for students to collaborate if they can work on one another’s devices,” said Kurt Madden.
</p>
<p>
    Edward Gonzalez said, “We’re just on the cusp of standardizing our devices, our training, and our mobile strategy. We’re actually here to soak up all the
    good ideas. We’re going to double the instructional technologists and we’re doing that to meet the challenges.”
</p>
<p>
    “I agree, and think that there has to be a standard,” said Dan Resciniti.
</p>
<p>
    Melanie Lewis said, “We hope to be fully transitioned in three years to a standard.”
</p>
<p>
    An audience member asked about “the long road,” addressed specifically to Edward Gonzalez.
</p>
<p>
    “We can’t see around the corner as far, and there will always be agenda gaps, and nothing can take the place of experience in addressing those. If you’re
    in learning, it’s important to learn to adapt and students will continue to learn from us and us from them,” Edward answered.
</p>
<p>
    “The Digital age is taking us to some pretty exciting places. I’m really trying to enjoy the journey,” said Edward.
