<br/>
<p>By LeiLani Cauthen</p><br/><br/>
<p>
    The Newark, NJ Digital Curriculum Strategy Discussion event on September 25th should not have happened, and definitely should not have been such a resounding success.
<br/><br/>
First of all, it was mistakenly calendared for the first day of Rosh Hashanah when most area schools are out.  Second, it was pouring rain and due to drop at least three-inches of wet in the morning alone. 
<br/><br/>
Yet, a decidedly positive crew of New Yorkers and Jerseans showed for one of the liveliest conversations had all year and all confirmed a veritable boom forthcoming of digital transformation.
<br/><br/>
It was an arrestingly gracious and loving group, more than expected and more than has been apparent in any other city.  Several times throughout the day various executives affirmed that they “start with love” as they approach the impending digital transformation – the same as their successful work with teaching and learning thus far. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>First Workshop with Superintendent Brian Gatens</strong>
<br/><br/>
Superintendent Brian Gatens of Emerson Public School District in New Jersey said one of the most memorable things of the day with, “For the last 1,000 years, if a teacher didn’t say it out loud, and the student didn’t write it down, it wasn’t learned.  The self-directed learning model is new.” 
<br/><br/>
As the discussion continued that morning, so much conversation happened that not all of it will be captured in this article. 
<br/><br/>
Gatens also said, “We have never seen such a disconnect as there is between what the home environment looks like, and what the classroom looks like now.”
<br/><br/>
Susan Ladd, Director of Curriculum for Point Pleasant Schools said “I don’t think we’ve ever before seen so much parent and student involvement.  Social media is creating that.” 
<br/><br/>
“We want to expose our kids to the same things (consumer electronics) parents are using.  We want to do more, but we also have to get agreement from parents,” said Davia Franklyn, Director of Teaching & Learning of the Newark Educators Community Charter School.
<br/><br/>
Superintendent Gatens lead the first Workshop of the morning.
<br/><br/>
“I’m here to learn just like everyone else.  We are actually in the middle of our 1-1 and all the districts around us are about to do a 1:1.  We’re now purchasing Chromebooks and using textbook funds to enable that purchase.  We have twelve iPads per classroom at the pre-K to second grade levels, and our 3-6th Graders are participating in a digital citizenship program which consists of a 45-day mini-cycle course.  So we’ve taken steps to move to digital.  We’re now looking at our own curriculum,” Gatens said.
<br/><br/>
“We’re closely looking at Google Classroom.  There are some issues with policies we want to review.  Through Google Classroom, teachers can help direct students in their learning and don’t have to be the source of that learning.  As central office, it’s our responsibility to select or choose what teachers are using,” Gatens said.
<br/><br/>
He continued with, “The world is significantly different than it was five years ago.  There are work settings that are incredibly different now – people never physically meeting each other.  Along those lines, there is a huge disconnect between the way we are teaching our children and the real world outside of our schools.”
<br/><br/>
“We’ve had a lot of meetings about our timeline for 1-1.  People always say they ‘went too fast’ in their roll-outs and didn’t consider all the policies and getting all teachers on board.  So we are taking our time and not just getting a couple of people on board, but lots of them.  That’s what a lot of places do, you know, they go talk to one or two lead teachers and principals and then that’s it – that’s the ‘we talked to the staff.’  That doesn’t work for me, we consulted with a lot more of our staff, and have formed a seventeen-member ‘Google Team’ to help advise and guide our implementation. So we don’t have artificial deadlines. We will just take our time and really consider how the change will work.”
<br/><br/>
“In terms of the funding streams, a fair amount of reallocation of our curriculum budget to digital curriculum and content is being done.  The Director of Curriculum and Instruction will vet any new App or curriculum before a teacher can use it.  Teachers are expected to reach out to their Principals and let them know, but with 100 teaches we aren’t too granular with what they are doing.  And they, of course, share with each other,” said Gatens.
<br/><br/>
He also said that, “There is new State policy on social media contact between teachers and students, there has to be transparency, so there are certain ‘no-nos’ with regards to social media that we’ve had to adopt policy about to reflect what the State expects.”  (Editor’s note -- The text of the law can be found here: http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/PL14/2_.HTM, and states that locally created school policy “shall include, at a minimum, provisions designed to prevent improper communications between school employees and students made via e-mail, cellular phones, social networking websites, and other Internet-based social media.)
<br/><br/>
 “We require policy that devices, even when they are at home, run through our servers.  Our storage is in-district or Google Vault, which is free for schools.  Now with the explosion of technology, we have fewer teachers who feel the need to build their own digital curriculum,” Gatens said.
<br/><br/>
After Superintendent Gatens spoke, the discussion continued and included several tech and curriculum publishers presenting their latest products and news. 
<br/><br/>
 <strong>“We’re a Family” Panel Discussion</strong>
<br/><br/>
At this Discussion event, it was all-too-apparent that New Jersey’s real transformation has “started with love.”   A refreshing new angle on strategy. 
<br/><br/>
The three panelists in Newark were:  
</p>
<p>
Adam Fried, Superintendent, Harrington Park School District;
<br/>
Takecia Saylor, Director, Office of School Innovation, New Jersey Department of Education;
<br/>
Beatrice Pierre, Director, Newark Public Schools.

<p>
Dr. David Kafitz of the Learning Counsel kicked of the panel conversation with an invitation for the panelists to talk about what they are doing to lead digital transition.
<br/><br/>
“We are providing a toolkit of resources for our teachers and students to use,” said Dr. Fried, “As educators we are asking the question of how we get to those key people who are innovators to push our message out (about going digital.)”
<br/><br/>
Takecia Saylor started with a description of her background.  “I’m a former software engineer turned educator,” she said.  “I represent a brand new department, the Office of Innovation.  I am happy to have taken the baton and run with it.  We want to see through our innovateNJ initiative innovative pockets of technology use highlighted across the state, and in doing so, create more opportunities for replication and adaptation of those by example.  By way of our innovateNJ initiative, we’ve chosen ten inductee innovative school districts we are working with this year.  A lot of our districts are small and function okay with technology and budget but others need help.  Our inductee innovateNJ Community Members are charged with serving as leaders in our expansion efforts, and we’re moving strategically to expand their results into other New Jersey School districts.”
<br/><br/>
Dr. Kafitz asked the three panelists about their biggest challenge.
<br/><br/>
“When we talk about our digital curriculum, the goal is the openness component, what that curriculum should be to (make it work on anything.)  We have a challenge with cognitive fluency so we are focused on how to overcome that with teachers and students.  I’ve looked at a Ted Talk about ‘School in the Cloud.”  There is having to manage the fearfulness of teachers and the resistance to those types of ideas.  That impedes our growth as a family, and we are a family.  We think of ourselves as a family, showing the love, that’s how we need and have to be to succeed.  We ask ourselves how we as a school family integrate the new technology into our lives,” said Dr. Fried.
<br/><br/>
Saylor said, “I agree with the idea of family. We brand ourselves as a resource, not as telling people what to do.  We are an ‘upliftment’ type of organization and a resource our school districts can tap into.  There are a lot of policies here in New Jersey for teachers to follow, so we try to provide the teachers with real help so they don’t feel left behind or that they have to catch up.  We provide resources of things like a qualified innovation partner list, details of local and national school innovation models, a model curriculum.  We know there are lots of blended, flipped, hybrid models in classrooms, but we want to facilitate and foster communication about them.  The innovateNJ initiative was created to do just that – fostering and facilitating communication around district and school level innovative practices across the State, not just with school districts within close proximity of each other, but North to South and East to West. We are seeing a shift of textbook money into new project areas.  We’re asking schools to plan for sustainability as a standard practice as they consider digital content delivery.”
<br/><br/>
Dr. Fried said, “We had to say – let’s not live in a ‘circumstance’ – we have to get our boots on the ground about making the change happen.”
<br/><br/>
“I don’t spend a lot of time speaking in challenge oriented language because people just want help,” said Saylor. “As a communications and resource-based initiative, the outreach is really about helping schools and I like to keep the conversation around solutions.”
<br/><br/>
Next Dr. Kafitz asked the panelists about equity issues, how are they addressing that in the move to digital.
<br/><br/>
“We have a lot of conversations about what we need to do to move forward beyond the devices and into the process.  We have to think beyond grade level stuff and into special departments,” said Dr. Fried.
<br/><br/>
Saylor said, “As educators, are charged with creating equity and access.  In Pascack Valley Regional High School District in Bergen County, as a part of their 1-1 initiative, there are cross content, interdisciplinary courses taught in a college lecture hall simulation, programs such as this and other innovative programs and practices we are in the process of identifying for  as a major part of the innovateNJ purpose. The innovateNJ Community members have begun to partner with other districts to help them, and we’re helping to broker that discussion.  We understand that increasing access and empowerment has to actually happen, and we can’t just talk about it.  We’re developing innovateNJ as a means of ensuring that New Jersey school districts are working together to spur action, and not just conversation.”
<br/><br/>
“There is a sense of urgency with this equity issue that I feel,” said Saylor.
<br/><br/>
“Who I am as a husband and father is who I am as a Superintendent,” said Dr. Fried.  “We want to save anyone who looks like they are falling through the cracks. I love the new emphasis on equity.”
<br/><br/>
“When I became a teacher, I was put into a classroom with 22 ‘holdovers’ repeating the third grade for the second or third time, and I was expected to get them promoted.  It was really hard work. I think people expected me to fail, but I did not,” said Saylor.  “As educators we do these things with love.  It’s the only way.  I think what has to be offered (within digital curriculum development) is something that will really do the job of teaching literacy rigorously, across content areas, that’s equity, and it demonstrates the love that students need.  It’s every student’s right to have education equity and access.”
<br/><br/>
LeiLani Cauthen, CEO and Publisher of the Learning Counsel, asked the panelists about any shifts in homework policy with the transition to digital curriculum, commenting that “in some places moving to blended learning has caused too many hours of homework because teachers from different subjects are not coordinated and parents get upset.”
<br/><br/>
 “There’s some flexibility in the State of New Jersey under our Option II Administrative Code for example,” Saylor said.  “High school students may acquire credit via the successful completion of assessments that may be competency based.  Also we found a lot of districts are tapping into media specialists who used to be librarians who can help with more of the ‘making and constructing’ projects to go with lessons, so a student may demonstrate ability, mastery and competency, in ways that are more personalized.”
<br/><br/>
Finishing off the day, Dr. Kafitz asked the panelist’s one last question about what they are looking for from vendors.
<br/><br/>
“Continued development of STEM programs is necessary, and with regard to literacy, there seems to be a lack of organization about it from the vendors,” said Saylor.
<br/><br/>
Dr. Fried said, “The ‘why’ needs to be answered.  Why do we need this? Of course, usable, accessible, and from a smart perspective it’s measurable and obtainable.”
