    <strong>A Day of Discussions on Digital Curriculum in Columbia, SC</strong>
</p>
<p>
    March 5, 2014
</p>
<p>
    <em>By LeiLani Cauthen</em>

<br>
<p>
    It’s hard to have a day of discussion when there is just so <em>much </em>to discuss and not enough time in the day. On February 27<sup>th</sup> at the
    Marriott in downtown Columbia, South Carolina, school district executives convened to talk about strategies for digital curriculum.
</p>
<p>
    Lots of surprises ruled the day. First, it was <em>cold</em> in the South. Columbia had just had a month of storms that resulted in multiple snow days. In
    the <em>South</em>. Yet, despite the snow days and administrative backlogs, school executives arrived in force.
</p>
<p>
    Let’s talk about what we talked about, then.
</p>
<p>
    First, The Learning Counsel welcomed the group of district executives and curriculum publishers with a short briefing on technology spending trends in
    2014. Included in this data were proprietary research studies on the state of learning apps from the main large platforms, comparing the iTunes world with
    Amazon, Microsoft and Google, and the growing scope of the digital curriculum and content publishing field.
</p>
<p>
    During the market briefing, Districts and industry attendees were still dropping in, picking up their coffee and yogurt and selecting a seat at the giant
    u-shaped meeting table on this crisp morning at 9:00 a.m. At one specific part of the market briefing, some jaws were dropping, some eyes narrowing, and
    some movement arrested briefly. Since I was <em>giving</em> the briefing, I was probably the only one to notice this as a sort of twitch across the whole
    of the audience.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Twitch in the Audience</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Without giving away The Learning Counsel’s “secret sauce” as to what we discuss particularly in our market briefing, or during the “discussion session”
    parts of the day-long event, let us just say that the twitch was not a unique reaction.
</p>
<p>
    The fact is that every school The Learning Counsel is calling into in 2014 has a level of agreement in the district’s ranks that there <em>needs</em> to be
    a strategy for digital curriculum. What is not very defined is what a digital curriculum strategy actual is and why it is needed.
</p>
<p>
    We might as well be calling the events tour the “WHY You Need a Digital Curriculum Strategy” instead of the Digital Curriculum Strategy Discussions. We
    were not really expecting this, and thought we’d be into far more heated actual strategy discussion. Instead the day felt more like the start of the
    consideration of <em>why</em>, with the exception of a couple of the Districts.
</p>
<p>
    The “why” makes people twitch. Just a little.
</p>
<p>
    While the statistics are there, the best thing to say in this article is this: in almost every district you can “look under the hood” and see that schools
    have a disparity of actual learning curriculum resources. From one school to the next they are unconsciously creating a new <em>curriculum </em>digital
    divide.
</p>
<p>
    The Learning Counsel is pointing out this new inequity. It’s the story of what-happens-after-you-rolled-out-a-bunch-of-devices or a BYOD and have a
    silently growing inequity on the curriculum and content side. It is also a new silent war for the attention and time of teachers and schools.
</p>
<p>
    Words like “inequity” and “liability,” cause twitchy executives, and well they should.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Back to the Beginning</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I started asking questions about real strategy for digital curriculum about four years ago while tromping through the market at various events and meetings
    with education executives. Typically I was assured there “was a strategy” but upon closer inspection I just had more questions.
</p>
<p>
    Here’s what’s going on. For the last 50 years or so school districts have been typically making huge purchases of textbooks and workbooks and signing off
    on multi-million dollar deals. Having done this, districts were typically “done” for several years with the bulk of curriculum planning in what was once a
    textbook centricity to teaching and learning. Textbooks and workbooks set the pace of most lesson planning and are still a major part of school spending.
    As digital curriculum of all types makes incursions into the centricity of textbooks, the whole of the planning structure is changing.
</p>
<p>
    In the last several years, digital computing devices made their way into schools, sometimes with 1-1 initiatives that covered perhaps a single grade or
    grade span such as middle school or high school, sometimes with a specific lab or cart wheeled from room to room. Teachers were mostly on their own finding
    or making learning content because “there was no money” to buy anything. This is because curriculum budgets were still mostly tied up in textbooks or funds
    were expended acquiring the hardware.
</p>
<p>
    With the introduction of the tablet form of digital device and software/content acquisition ecosystems that supported them came an explosion of education
    media touting articles like “The Top 10 Apps” or “138 Digital Curriculum Tools,” etc. There is a seemingly endless parade of pieces of content and voices
    favoring one over another, and lists and lists of potentials.
</p>
<p>
    During the roll-outs in many schools, the tech and district curriculum leaders would choose a handful of main apps for universal use. These were normally
    collaboration type tools and such. Everything else that might be needed to transport the teaching and learning in any subject, any grade, to more digital
    content and replace the traditional textbook was largely left up to the teacher. This began a wave of purchasing at the school level that is now a sizeable
    portion of all digital curriculum spend and typically not inventoried by the Districts.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, you can peruse the multiple school websites under any one district and find a disparity of digital curriculum resources.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>The New Digital Divide</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There has always been a difference from one school to the next as to learning resources, but not as openly and easily sensed such as we have now with the
    internet, where it can be seen which schools have what resources. It is this near-transparency that makes all the difference.
</p>
<p>
    If one school has managed to offer all students access to digital curriculum, a host of apps, lists of resource sites, video lecture capture, and online
    collaboration tools, and another school in the same district is not, well, that is most potentially to be interpreted as an inequity even if the other
    schools have generally the same content in offline forms. The perception by education consumers is that more is better -- even if that is not really the
    case. This is especially true now that parents are buying unprecedented numbers of learning games and apps for their children themselves and have an
    expectancy of technology-rich curriculum content. It will take only one instance of a parent calling out a conflict from one school to another in their
    area to draw the voracious public press into negative public exposure. The problem is perception, and when schools are listing what they have online or
    demonstrating online that they <em>don’t </em>have resources, it is an easier comparison to make than in the days of paper textbooks. In those days you
    would have had to go and look at the state of materials across the whole population of students. Studies in the past, though little known, did show there
    were inequities even then. See “
    <a href="http://www.decentschools.com/expert_reports/oakes_report_2.pdf">
        Access to Textbooks, Instructional Materials, Equipment, and Technology: Inadequacy and Inequality in California’s Public Schools
    </a>
    .”
</p>
<p>
    Now anyone with a browser can make comparisons on quantity as well as a perceived quality of branded resources sites.
</p>
<p>
    Deepening the plot is a growing consumerization of education, where thousands of apps, Luminosity, Khan Academy, Coursera, totally virtual universities,
    and ebooks have landed live in the public psyche, making them feel like anything can be adapted just for them. Or their child.
</p>
<p>
    If there is a perception of inequity or inadequacy, there is a strategy issue for Districts that falls into the category of liability. In many States,
    equity in education access includes learning resources and is part of the wording in laws.
</p>
<p>
    It’s important to note that what has happened is a faster pace of change while things went digital, causing the teaching community to want what used to be
    a prescriptiveness in a whole textbook to be disaggregated much like iTunes disaggregated the music album. Changes in mathematics teaching, in the social
    sciences and other subject areas were causing too much single-chapter use anyway, ostensibly wasting a lot of money on unused elements in expensive
    textbooks.
</p>
<p>
    A way to summarize the “why” of digital curriculum strategy is this:
</p>
<p>
    When you tear out a central element that provided guidance and order around which other things revolved, such as the age-old textbook and educational
    “kits,” and replace them with thousands of disaggregated smaller pieces as alternatives that may not do the job even summed together, you have changed a
    fundamental building block and in turn need to change structure and strategy to adapt to that. And no, this is not an advocacy for the textbook to come
    back but an observation that something is up – so let’s have a strategy discussion about the implementation and use of digital curriculum.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Back to What Happened in Columbia</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The executives who attended in Columbia, and indeed those signing up for other cities, appear to all be enticed by the prospect of a digital curriculum
    strategy. The mere concept of it is alluring, but not for simple or even ubiquitous reasons.
</p>
<p>
    Included in the group in Columbia were some pretty savvy district executives who were aware of the embattled teacher levels. They were all avid note-takers
    during every industry presentation.
</p>
<p>
    Angela Hinton, Assistant Superintendent for Instruction, and Trisha Meadows, Director of Instructional Tech, Data &amp; Testing, both from Spartansburg 2,
    talked about their experiences using Edmentum curriculum in positive tones.
</p>
<p>
    Tonia Smith, Coordinator of Special Projects, of Clarendon School District Two, mentioned an upcoming 1-1 initiative and being part of the planning for the
    District’s $3 Million recent Race-to-the-Top grant. She was happy to be there and participated in the later Panel, answering questions about her District’s
    vision.
</p>
<p>
    IXL’s presentation by Jim Coulon talked about some of their digital math curriculum’s ability to be flexible and use what’s needed for the individual
    student. When speaking about the inclusive metrics of their digital curriculum, Jim mentioned that IXL “Believes data should be collected to help guide and
    differentiate for the individual student.”
</p>
<p>
    During Promethean’s presentation, Joanie Pond said “We’re all about bringing it all together,” and that “Promethean believes in engagement, personalizing
    learning with collaboration customized for the student, and real application.” Joanie also said that “Learning should not be a by-product of a 1-1
    deployment, it should be the primary objective.”
</p>
<p>
    Regarding having a 1-1 plan, Joanie said, “You need a vision that everyone is on board with to create real change. You otherwise get a bit of confusion,
    resistance, and no motivation. You can get subversives, and destructiveness, so you do need an action plan. Usually a good vision is driven by a
    Superintendent to really get compliance.”
</p>
<p>
    During his presentation, Ernie Delegado of BeyondTechEd, said “The bottleneck is usually teachers, from rockstars to fearful won’t-do-it types, but that’s
    changing because more people are realizing what is good about tech integration.” Ernie stressed “Confidence, Competence, and Content,” in school’s
    transition, which he said “is not happening fast enough for corporate America.” He presented data on the fastest growing job categories and how schools
    could be fostering 21<sup>st</sup> Century skills. He also talked about assessing, training and supporting teachers so that they can assimilate tech into
    lesson planning.
</p>
<p>
    With regards to the burgeoning changes in the curriculum side, Ernie talked about imagining having been given a brand new electric car, and then finding
    there were no roads and nowhere to go. This was often the experience of teachers after major 1-1 roll-outs. He was cautious in how schools should look at
    their transition, citing valuable experience in seeing and consulting on actual workable transitions. He mentioned that BeyondTechEd “Looks at things in
    4-year chunks and, unfortunately, that <em>is</em> how long it talks to retool all your teachers.” BeyondTechEd also showed interesting curriculum called
    “The CEO Challenge.”
</p>
<p>
    At lunch we began our digital curriculum strategy discussion by first discussing the definition of digital curriculum strategy and, briefly, how it wasn’t
    quite the same as curriculum mapping. We also showed all the areas of inventory that need to be addressed, and the areas of analysis.
</p>
<p>
    One super-smart executive from Horry County Schools, Cynthia Ambrose, had her strategy sketched out even before the end of the second hour of discussions.
    Cynthia also mentioned their schools spend months over every summer on curriculum mapping for their schools.

<br>
<p>
    After lunch, Lisa Fraine of Florida Virtual School (FVLS) showed test scores after various programs and talked about working with other schools in an
    augmentative fashion as well as covering core curriculum areas with 100% virtual programs when a school found itself without a teacher temporarily. Lisa
    mentioned that her history as a classroom teacher was not quite adequate to being an online teacher in her career at FVLS. She said “I thought I was a good
    classroom teacher, but moving to online I realized I really didn’t know anyone but the extroverts in my class. The rest I didn’t know. I had to work
    differently because engagement online was easier – the non-extroverts were more engaged and interacting, which was more work, but good!”
</p>
<p>
    When demonstrating some of the actual curriculum, Lisa also said that FVLS “Likes to use tabs and chunking the content up, like videos, glossaries that
    support other elements. And we teach note-taking skills with the content, providing rubrics for assessing later on and honors lessons built in for schools
    that have that. Some of the content has simulations built in, but not full gaming.”
</p>
<p>
    Edi Cox, Director of Online Learning of Horry County Schools said, “We started an online program a few years ago, using Florida Virtual School and then
    later started to use and build our own. We wanted the best in the nation, so now use FVLS for some parts of what we offer and then actually contract to
    enroll kids directly into FVLS. But if it gets to a certain level, we seek to build part of that ourselves. FVLS’s teacher interaction is sometimes better
    than we had been delivering live in the classroom, and we learned a lot from that.”
</p>
<p>
    Bruce Lammers of Atomic Learning talked about helping districts reach goals with teachers going “from awkward to awesome” in their technology integration
    into lessons. He said Atomic Learning is “a bunch of former Tech Directors from schools who developed tech training to help teachers and students learn.”
    Their solution provides a wide array of staff development tools and allows schools to upload their own content as well.
</p>
<p>
    Upon resuming the discussion, The Learning Counsel invited one sponsor, Tom Winterstein of Adrenna to offer a few words to the group. He spoke about how we
    consume entertainment and some new trends that were changing the landscape. He asked, “Does anyone know about the ‘cord-cutters’ or ‘cord-shavers’?” None
    of us had, so he elaborated on a new trend where he said, “Individuals are dropping out of cable and satellite service to their televisions or going with
    diminished service of just the internet, and television stations are gearing up for dramatic shift to web programming.”
</p>
<p>
    “The future will maybe not be wired or satellite but web,” he said, and challenged the group to consider where things could be going with education
    technology if such large shifts were happening.
</p>
<p>
    Tom talked about Adrenna reinventing the Learning Management System to also manage the learning process itself, and have both platform and content. He
    stressed that in their new system, “Like Netflix, no one cares how it works, they just want their movie, so we knew we had to build Adrenna that way.”
</p>
<p>
    “It takes a passion for teaching and helps to continue that. That (concept) was elemental to our system design – transparency, so it’s not distractive as a
    system to use and takes a bunch of training,” said Tom.
</p>
<p>
    The Columbia Digital Curriculum Strategy Discussion ended with much discussion during the Panel Briefing and Reception.
