<br/>
<p>
    The Digital Curriculum Strategy Discussion in Denver on September 9th started with observations on what the area has gone through with the changes in the economy.
<br/><br/>
“Well, we found out we could no longer really afford to transport kids, and so we had to get creative about how we were delivering education,” said David Knoche, Principal, Falcon Virtual Academy, Falcon School District 49 in Colorado Springs. 
<br/><br/>
“We found that changing our tactics with stuff (because of the economy) was limited by union contracts,” said another person in the meeting. 
<br/><br/>
Other comments included the fact that many districts were in discussions about moving the traditional textbook monies into digital curriculum, and finding other ways to creatively fund all the technology infrastructure.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Dynamic Discussion</strong>
<br/><br/>
As the first hour of discussion about what a digital curriculum strategy really is went on, lots of other comments came from the group meeting at the Adams 12 Five Star Schools facility in Thornton, Colorado. 
<br/><br/>
“We put in a digital math curriculum and found that it’s changing things, how we do things,” said James Steward, Principal, Hidden Lake High School, Adams County School District 50 in Westminster. 
<br/><br/>
Regarding the transition towards more digital curriculum, Amy Bland, Technical Services Librarian of Boulder Valley School District, said “We have a lot of parents concerned about screen time for their kids, how many hours the kids will be in front of screens.” 
<br/><br/>
Another member of the meeting mentioned that Colorado is using digital testing now and commented that, for their district it “went awesome.”  Trevor Timmons, Director of Technology, Weld Re-4 School District in Windsor said for them it was “a mixed bag of kids looking at the screens, unsure of what to do.”
<br/><br/>
Judy Bauernschmidt, the Executive Director of the eLearning Collaborative said that, with regards to getting into digital curriculum, “the larger districts get better pricing, there is a huge disparity in pricing for smaller districts.” 
<br/><br/>
Echoing this sentiment, Dan Morris, Director of eNet Learning commented that, “A lot of times big publishers don’t view rural districts as a market.  That’s a real challenge, getting publishers to view rural consortiums as a viable market.” 
<br/><br/>
“A number of districts have people making policy for digital that wasn’t really tech savvy, so they’re making decisions without really knowing the security issues and all that,“ said Jerry McCarthy, Distance Learning Project Manager, State of Colorado Office of Information Technology.
<br/><br/>
“What I noticed is that mostly the digital curriculum is a credit recovery mode.  So it’s seen as a burden for the student, they have to do it to recover credits,” said Kerry             Glenn, STEM Coordinator, Adams 12.  
</p>

<br/><br/>
<p>
   In response to Dr. David Kafitz’s question to the group about how their Districts’ are creating a culture of change, Dan Morris mentioned that, “What I see is that many schools are having every individual teacher making decisions on their own.” 
<br/><br/>
“I see two myths (in our district), one that it’s (digital curriculum) is less personal and there will be less of a student-teacher relationship, and two that it replaces teachers so you can have more students, like 40 or more in every class,” said Amy Bland.
<br/><br/>
Eugene Hainer, Assistant Commissioner with the Colorado Department of Education/State Library mentioned that the myth he sees is that, “You don’t need libraries any more – but research proves that you do need libraries. Far from being obsolete, innovations in today’s libraries and the impact they have on the curation of content and availability of digital information are vital for lifelong learning”.
<br/><br/>
“Eliminating librarians is also a myth. They are equally critical to student success since they are trained to connect teachers and students with vital 21st century skills, and communicate research techniques and resources to prepare for college or careers,” Hainer said.
<br/><br/>
(Editor’s Note:  Hainer sent the research he alluded to with this link:  <a href="http://www.lrs.org/data-tools/school-libraries/impact-studies/" target="_blank">http://www.lrs.org/data-tools/school-libraries/impact-studies/</a>)
<br/><br/>
Timmons commented that all the OER resources can be a burden, and that a lot of publisher free materials can be as well, saying that, “Free is not free…free is like a puppy being free.” 
<br/><br/>
Dr. Violeta Garcia, STEM Education Coordinator of the Colorado Department of Education mentioned that “Digital curriculum needs to be dynamic, not flat content like a pdf.”
<br/><br/>
“There’s a level of complexity in this that all of us are grappling with, and it needs to be an interactive process as well.  We need to get the feedback.  There’s so much unknown.  It’s really thinking about the flexibility that’s needed,” said Deagan Andrews, Director of eLearning Services of Greeley-Evans School District 6. 
<br/><br/>
Bauernschmidt said that, “As a parent of blended learners in Jefferson County, I’ve seen it differ teacher-by-teacher.  One of my son’s teachers offered a blended model, and he, the teacher, couldn’t believe how much parents really supported it.  It’s really what parents are looking for.” 
<br/><br/>
“I really think one of the things that’s overlooked is administrative buy-in.  It needs to be systemic so it can’t be lost with a new principal coming in (to a school.)  It’s the principal who needs to get parent buy-in,” said Steward.
<br/><br/>
<strong>First Workshop</strong>
<br/><br/>
Cheri Wrench, Executive Director of Interdisciplinary Learning of Denver Public Schools delivered a workshop about strategy for the whole Discussion group.  She mentioned that she is over education tech, academic portals, arts, distance learning, physical education and library services. 
<br/><br/>
“When I’m looking for resources,” Wrench said, “I have to first ask, ‘What do you have in Spanish for me?’ because we have such a large Spanish speaking population of students.” 
<br/><br/>
She also said that, “While some of the small districts have teachers who have to curate their own content, there are issues in big districts (like Denver) as well, just different issues.” 
<br/><br/>
“We’re focused on personalized learning.  In the Denver plan we have five goals:
</p>
<p>
1)      Personalize for student success,
<br/><br/>
2)      Support the whole child,
<br/><br/>
3)      College and career readiness,
<br/><br/>
4)      Close the gap,
<br/><br/>
5)      State strategies, core beliefs and values.
</p>
<p>
    And, we see that our vision is only realized through action,” Wrench said.
<br/><br/>
Wrench showed a short video created for the Denver Public Schools that helped communicate their vision and what they are doing to go digital. 
<br/><br/>
“Denver has 59,000 curriculum items, Denver-created and publisher materials,” Wrench said.  “We’re asking questions about App planning and if free is free.  When data is being taken in about students by publishers is it really free? We need to consider all of that.  We have to get more strategic, but we do value our own autonomy.  We really want to use a single IMS (Instructional Management System.)”
<br/><br/>
“We could have a whole discussion (in this room) about student data security and privacy.  We don’t want to be involved in the inBloom type of schema’s etc., so we are doing continuous inspection of our work.  We are also pioneering a new procurement process and we have a personalized learning framework,” said Wrench.
<br/><br/>
Next Superintendent Ed Vandertook of Strasburg School District 31J conducted a workshop for the whole group. 
<br/><br/>
“What a great opportunity we have today to talk with each other and the vendors in the room about what we need,” said Vandertook. 
<br/><br/>
“We don’t call it Common Core here, we call it Colorado Academic Standards.  We’re sensitive to the terms.  Actually it was 1993 that the first laws were put in place for the Standards here.  We have to be aware of project planning for change.  As a smaller District, I don’t have as many vendors knocking on my door, but we do need that input, and for vendors to leverage the cooperative,” said Vandertook.
<br/><br/>
(Editor’s Note:  The standards in Colorado are actually called "Colorado Academic Standards" (CAS.) See <a href="http://www.cde.state.co.us/standardsandinstruction/coloradostandards" target="_blank">http://www.cde.state.co.us/standardsandinstruction/coloradostandards</a>)
<br/><br/>
“What is the advantage of digital curriculum?  The definition I have to curriculum is what we are going to teach, but now digital is also how.  I always ask, how do you correlate the standards.  There are really three legs we look at in each instance (of choosing curriculum): standards, instruction and assessment.  I use a simple definition of blended learning – the use of technology in the instructional process.”
<br/><br/>
“One of the things I’ve learned is that, with the use of technology, it doesn’t mean you always have to accelerate learning, you can also broaden the materials,” said Vandertook. 
<br/><br/>
“What was interesting in Strasburg is that we’ve gone wireless.  When we put that in, we found students had multiple devices.  A lot of our students bring their own devices, but that brings up new security and access issues,” said Vandertook.
<br/><br/>
Vandertook went on to say, “One of the challenges I would give to the vendors is for you to ask how your technology is going to change the culture and learning environment, and how do we get the people to make that change.  One of the advantages we have in Strasburg is that we’re nimble, but we still have to have the buy-in of all the users.”
<br/><br/>
“In terms of inventory, I have to plan how many resources teachers have to meet their objectives.  The issue is how to buy, and I ask, am I buying the best?  How do I know?  How do I get through that procurement process?” 
<br/><br/>
“I ask the question of what do we want the students to know and do.  We participate in cooperative purchasing because we have to leverage our resources.  As a Superintendent, I have to realize that in five years it will look different again – so that prioritizes what I do with inventory and where I will spend my resources.  I do look at what’s exciting and new, like with things like math, doing some innovative programs for that,” said Vandertook. 
<br/><br/>
LeiLani Cauthen, CEO and Publisher at the Learning Counsel asked Vandertook about doing any specialty programs for students like robotics or teaching GIS (geographic information systems.) 
<br/><br/>
“We tried that, we tried GIS to attract students and parents, but those types of things are so dependent on what teacher resources you have on hand and that’s always a problem.  If you lose that one teacher that can do it, you lose the program in a small district,” said Vandertook.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Practical Leadership</strong>
<br/><br/>
Sam Morris, Worldwide Education Segment Executive, of Lenovo helped kick off the practical leadership workshop in the early afternoon.  Initially the group discussed policy, including what verbal policies might be pervading the workforce of a district versus only those that are written.  
<br/><br/>
In the discussion of programs, several areas came to the forefront as ones that schools needed to address.  Running a program to get authentic feedback, running a program to get the procurement process to match the new reality, and having genuine leadership.

<p>
<strong>Panel Discussion</strong>
<br/><br/>
Dr. David Kafitz of the Learning Counsel led the panel discussion in the afternoon.  Panelists were Judy Bauernschmidt, Superintendent Ed Vandertook, and Kahle Charles, Executive Director of Curriculum from St. Vrain Valley School District.
<br/><br/>
Kafitz first asked about funding creativity for the transition to digital.
<br/><br/>
“Well, our Superintendent has really engaged our community to fund technology as a constant.  It was pretty creative to go to our community and get that funding in a four-year commitment,” said Charles.
<br/><br/>
“From a District’s view, we were able to do some resource sharing from the virtual program to fund professional development, which was (pretty innovative,)” said Bauernschmidt, referring to her previous role as the Director of Student Online Learning for Jefferson County Schools, locally known as Jeffco. (Judy was also previously the Chief Authorizing Officer at the Colorado Charter School.)
<br/><br/>
Vandertook said, “The Board game me three directives:  staff, security and technology.  So, that made it easy because there was a set-aside for tech spending.” 
<br/><br/>
Kafitz next asked about the panelist’s viewpoint of what has been good about technology adoption or change. 
<br/><br/>
“The ability to afford great curriculum, that could include gaming aspects is unattainable on a district-wide scale.  When I was at Jeffco, even with large budgets we couldn’t afford sustainable purchase, so the renewals were at risk.  That prompted us to create many of our own digital courses,” said Bauernschmidt.
<br/><br/>
“We have had to have tools to get the teacher to be more of a facilitator than dispenser.  The (good thing) that the tech let us do with that shift is to look at individual students,” said Vandertook.
<br/><br/>
Charles said, “I like what Ed (Vandertook) said – it’s about the students, but I also find the tech can really also provide real administrative value as well.  But it’s a true paradigm shift for teachers, and we have some who are freaking out right now.  But, we’re being sure to give adequate PD for them.” 
<br/><br/>
“Teachers have been asking to have the ability to really customize their digital courses, and that is why we at the eLearning Collaborative are doing what we are doing building the digital content warehouse,” said Bauernschmidt.
<br/><br/>
“Teachers want single sign-on, but that’s been very hard for vendors to provide, and it’s those little logistical things that are big barriers for teachers and students.  If we frustrate them, they revert to old ways and won’t get into more technology after that – they’re not willing if we give them too many failures,” said Charles. 
<br/><br/>
Vandertook said, “Vendors really need to build a relationship with me so I can tell you what I really need by grade.  Plus I need to know what does it do better than what we’re already doing.”
<br/><br/>
Kafitz next asked about the pace of change, how the panelist’s see District’s dealing with that.
<br/><br/>
“Having reliable products really helps us feel comfortable.  We’re asking about how teachers can really use the products presented to us (from the technology vendors,)” said Charles.
<br/><br/>
Bauernschmidt said, “The second and third generation LMS’s (Learning Management Systems) out there are so much easier to train teachers and students to use, and that has made a big difference in the (pace of change.) When we switched to a more user friendly and intuitive platform it made so much difference.  The old joke has been, if Rip Van Winkle woke up today he’d be most comfortable in the classroom, so we really do need to lead the change and adoption.”
<br/><br/>
A member of the audience interjected a comment, saying, “paying for content needs to be rethought – modularized more.”
<br/><br/>
Vandertook said, “Yeah, one thing is there is no silver bullet.  There’s always going to be purchase of supplemental materials anyway.” 
<br/><br/>
“Well, we’ve mapped our instructional materials to our requirements, but if you have something that a teacher really wants to use, we tell them please do,” Charles said.
<br/><br/>
With regards to whether a District should be more prescriptive with what digital curriculum to use, an audience member mentioned, “Well, novice teachers, when you supplement with lots of different things and don’t just tell them what to use, they do worse. But with veteran teaches, the students do better.” 
<br/><br/>
Dan Morris spoke up and said, “In a rural District, they like teachers to supplement as they see fit, but then their turn-over is low.  In a larger District, it’s a lot less predictable.” 
<br/><br/>
“Usually you provide a minimally viable product for a teacher so you don’t overwhelm them,” Bauernschmidt said.
<br/><br/>
The day ended with comments from several executives in the room about the future of education.
<br/><br/>
“We all like the student-centered approach,” said Charles, “We know everyone will need some understanding about how to get there.”
