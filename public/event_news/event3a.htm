    <br>

<br>
<p>
    For the Digital Curriculum Strategy Discussion meeting at the beautiful Jack E. Singley Academy conference facility in Irving, Texas, students of the culinary arts program provided breakfast and a wonderful lunch for incoming education executives from the greater Dallas metro area on September 18th, 2014. 
</p>
<p>
Initially the conversation centered on what a digital curriculum strategy actually is, and started with the group discussing what myths they need to get their schools to think past. 
</p>
<p> 
One myth included how many kids actually did have access to the internet from home, which was more than had been expected.  Other myths the schools were working through included how much Professional Development was actually needed – a lot more than originally thought.  Also that the teachers can all just “do it themselves” to transition to digital, but that was really a myth because classrooms ended up with a huge number of passwords for kids and that created big problems. 
</p>
<p> 
Guest speakers, Ernie Stripling, Technology Information Officer at Denton ISD and Troy Bagwell, Director of Technology, Decatur Independent School District, gave talks during morning workshops. 
</p>
<p>
“I really like the idea of gaming in education,” Ernie Stripling said. “It (gaming) meets the WIIFM, ‘what’s in it for me’ driver for kids, something that’s talked about in the book ‘Reality is Broken,’ which I recommend reading.”  
</p>
<p>
“Education can be slow to adopt change,” said Stripling.  “For example, here we are today talking about digital curriculum and the truth is that some teachers think they’re using it if they have PowerPoint.”  
</p>
<p>
Stripling also talked about the “tipping point” for teachers to use more technology is “16% of teachers using, then all teachers will start.”  He also said, “At Denton, we’re the richest of the poor, we’re the MacGyvers of school districts (in terms of how innovative we have to be with different teaching styles.)  We go from internet-based instruction to textbooks and everything in between.”  
</p>
<p>
“One of the things we do,” said Stripling, “is create a conversation at 8:30 p.m. every Thursday night with #DentonChat.  Teachers are on that.  They love to pilot new things, and recently we got 65 teaches to pilot Google docs.  That functionality has basically revolutionized the classroom.”  
</p>
<p>
Troy Bagwell also spoke about what is happening at Decatur ISD.  “We have no plans currently for BYOD but I do see it as an eventuality,” he said.  “We have a culture of mobility in our district that would better support BYOD now that we have had a 1:1 program for a while. I think we are better prepared for that eventuality.”
</p>
<p>
“We’re all about engaging instruction,” Bagwell said, “having curriculum instructors be the driver rather than tech be the driver, and so enabling with technology rather than prescribing technology.  Our motto is ‘Future Ready’. We’ve had to be careful not to confuse curriculum with instructional resources, so a textbook isn’t a curriculum – it’s an instructional resource.” 
</p>
<p>
The group briefly discussed how sometimes individual teachers or schools purchase Apps or subscriptions to sites that might not work with the devices a school has or meet the instructional requirements.
</p>
<p>
Holly Davis, Chief Technology Officer of Little Elm Independent School District, spoke up and mentioned that, in her district, “We wiped the slate clean so that all curriculum resources go through the curriculum people and then back through someone centrally to see if it will work with the technology.”
</p>
<p>
With regards to the transition to digital curriculum, Bagwell also mentioned that Decatur has adopted a lot of digital resources like McGraw Hill and some others.  Decatur has, however, “met resistance from some parents to the idea of no textbooks because they think the textbook is the path,” said Bagwell.  
</p>
<p>
While Bagwell was speaking, a question from another educator was, “Do you see parents worried about teachers not leading? Like the shift puts the teacher in the role of facilitation?  Were parents upset and saying that tech is replacing the teacher?”
</p>
<p>
Bagwell responded, “We gave training on the flipped classroom, and those teachers who didn’t do it well actually were accused of ‘not teaching,’ because of the difference in flipping a class. Basically we leave that up to the principal to handle, but the teachers do have a protocol they are supposed to follow.”  
</p>
<p>
Teela Watson, Director of Digital Learning from Region 11 Education Service Center, spoke up and mentioned, “Yes, I had my son’s teacher who did a good job of communicating to us and that’s really key about the transition to digital curriculum.  It’s really all about communication.  Plus the homework policy needs to be addressed.”  
</p>
<p>
<strong>Afternoon Panel Conversation</strong><br/><br/>
Dr. David Kafitz of the Learning Counsel led the panel in a conversation about the shift to digital curriculum in their districts in the afternoon.
</p>
<p>
Panel guests included:
</p>
<p>
Ernie Stripling, Technology Information Officer at Denton ISD, 
</p>
<p>
Donna Henry, Digital Learning Leader/LISD Virtual Learning at Lewisville Independent School District, 
</p>
<p>
and Karla Burkholder, Ed.D., Director of Instructional Technology at Northwest ISD. 
</p>
<p> 
Dr. Kafitz asked the panelists to first elaborate about their district and their view of digital curriculum.
</p>
<p>
<strong>View of Digital Curriculum</strong><br/><br/>
“We like to leverage third-party solutions when we have the need to have awesome instructional design that meets the standards and a lot of other things.  We are a large district in transition with 1X implementation. ‘1x’ because it’s the ‘right tool for the task at hand’ ideal. It’s iPads, Chromebooks, some Windows machines, we look at what device is right for what purpose,” said Donna Henry.
</p>
<p>  
“We’re also a fast-growth school district in the sixth year of our 1-1 implementation.  We have laptops and iPads, and are really getting kids from an early age using devices for life.  Our people are truly instructional leaders,” said Dr. Karla Burkholder.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Leadership</strong><br/><br/>
Dr. Kafitz also asked about the positive factors and people that were leading in the panelists’ districts.
</p>
<p>
“Our Superintendent and our School Board, and sometimes the kids, are leading for us,” said Dr. Burkholder.
</p>
<p>
“For Lewisville, we’re in a 5-year strategic process.  Digital learning is part of that, including a strategic design process led by our Superintendent and School Board,” said Henry. 
</p>
<p> 
“Our Superintendent and School Board had everyone in our district leadership read the book ‘Schools Can’t Do It Alone.’  Actually the Superintendent practically had the entire county reading that book – he took it to the Kiwanis club, county meetings and more places. That was really a (flash point) for the district.  We have also had students leading from the bottom up,” said Stripling.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Funding Shifts</strong><br/><br/>
“We budget what we can, although we’ve had several tough years,” said Stripling. “Really, the building of a strategy will not flourish if (each) principal is not behind and doing it, blogging or using Facebook or something.  One shift is that we are not buying Chromebooks and giving every teacher an iPad.”
</p>
<p>
“Our funding is coming from the PTA, bond funds, learning how to maneuver better, not really from any one pot of funding, but across the board change,” said Henry.
Dr. Burkholder said, “The major investments in infrastructure and devices are pretty much done with bond money, and then we have a Foundation that teachers can apply to if they need something interesting for technology.” 
</p>
<p> 
Wrapping up the day, Donna Henry mentioned that, for their district, “We really have done a good job, we’ve moved forward.  The community outside is defining what learning should like and it has helped redefine us positively.”
