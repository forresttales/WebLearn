    <strong>Panel Briefing in Columbia, South Carolina</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Columbia Digital Curriculum Strategy Discussion event, held February 27<sup>th</sup>, hosted a special panel of senior executives from districts.
</p>
<p>
    Panelists included Cynthia Ambrose, Chief Academic Officer, Horry County Schools (far right), Gary Black, CTO, District 5 of Lexington and Richland
    Counties (far left), and Tonia Smith, Coordinator of Special Projects, Clarendon School District Two (middle.)

    Panel Leader
</p>
<p>
    David Bezzant, Senior National Director, Government &amp; Education Mobility Solutions, T-Mobile
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Introductions</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Learning Counsel asked David Bezzant, Senior National Director, Government &amp; Education Mobility Solutions at T-Mobile to host the Panel Briefing.
    David began by thanking the panelists for being there and made a brief statement about T-Mobile’s new “$1 for each device” solution.
</p>
<p>
    This was perhaps the most interesting moment because, as David spoke about schools being able to purchase different types of tablet computers for just $1,
    many of the attendees nodded slowly. It’s certainly a new concept to purchase devices for only $1, and through a contract for broadband access that could
    be “erate-able.” Such a consideration opens the possibilities for many programs to purchase the digital curriculum they need, which is an eye-opener and
    could probably have taken up a good amount of discussion time. Instead, David moved graciously into his role as Panel leader and invited first Gary Black,
    CTO of District 5 of Lexington and Richland Counties to introduce himself and say a little about what his District was doing.
</p>
<p>
    “We have deployed about 4,000 devices and gave teachers devices a year in advance so that they would be comfortable in their working with them,” said Gary.
</p>
<p>
    Tonia Smith of Clarendon said, “We’re a proud recipient of a Race-to-the-Top Grant, and one of our imperatives is to personalize student learning. We are
    looking at devices and LMS’s. 1,800 devices must be in kids’ hands by Labor Day under the federal guidelines.”
</p>
<p>
    Cynthia Ambrose said, “We have 40,000 students. Our best schools are title one schools where we have noticed real growth in math trends, and we saw that
    those teachers were really ready to embrace the technology for change. Now we’re ready for more schools.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Next, David asked Gary, Tonia and Cynthia about what was challenging their districts. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    “Our challenges have been getting teachers to choose and change. We found the only reason for a device they wanted was ‘because it was so thin.” And we
    wanted them to think about what was good for a student,” said Tonia.
</p>
<p>
    Gary said, “Our biggest thing is getting teachers to realize it’s okay for students to look at their devices. Sometimes they’re taking notes. We have to
    work hard at changing the teacher mindset.”
</p>
<p>
    “For us, it’s been about communication, communication, communication,” said Cynthia, because we’re so large, we were having misunderstandings, etc.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Next, David asked about how the districts were dealing with equity issues in devices and resource access to online resources now, and what about beyond
        the school day for at-home use?
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    “We’re 24x7 in Lexington 5, providing services because we want students to have their resources <em>all</em> the time. Even at Grandma’s house or so mom
    and dad can help a student at home with the same materials they were looking at in the morning,” said Gary.
</p>
<p>
    “We can’t yet let kids take the devices home,” said Cynthia.
</p>
<p>
    Tonia said, “We’re going to do grades 3-8 and later the rest. At the lower grades, we’re not letting the devices go home at all, but others, we’re going to
    let them, but we’re concerned with homes that don’t have access. We’re an 86% free-and-reduced lunch district, so it’s a real concern that students won’t
    have internet access at home.”
</p>
<p>
    Gary said, “When it comes to providing equity and resources, part of that is students who can get their devices working. We use a 5-minute rule so if a
    teacher can fix something in 5 minutes, that’s all the time they spend on it, otherwise we send in IT to fix it.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>David next asked the panel to talk about positive outcomes they had been experiencing with devices and digital curriculum. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Tonia volunteered that, “We have some digital learning in pockets, but some teachers just putting stuff on iPads, and some of our wins have to do with the
    fact that our students are desired by local companies, which means we are doing something right.”
</p>
<p>
    “Well, we’ve all seen classes where there are some kids you just can’t reach, but now with having implemented blended learning, you can really have
    everyone engaged and everyone getting personalized learning and have a profound impact on kids,” said Cynthia.
</p>
<p>
    “Our win is that one kid actually had to ask, when he saw a textbook, how to turn it on!” said Gary. “Ah, but now we have kids asking to build their own
    apps, which really shows we have been getting them into technology,” he said.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The next question David asked the panel was, “How do you see funding changing or restructuring?”</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Gary said “Our real ultimate plan is what we invented with a term, ‘Device Adaptable Technology Solutions’ or ‘DATS.’ We want to build our network for any
    student device so combo BYOD and device issuance all work. We have more needs in the district than just buying devices, obviously, but that’s a start.”
</p>
<p>
    “We’re looking at leasing instead of buying or maybe cutting of other tech areas, and using less print and ink and also going to cloud for storage,” said
    Tonia. She also said, “A big thing is having the leadership to really <em>lead</em> with technology.”
</p>
<p>
    Cynthia said, “We had capital projects covered by a tax increase at one time, but (we) are now very prudent and conservative with that 1-cent sales tax
    from a county ballot referendum.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>David Kafitz of The Learning Counsel asked the panel about how they try to accommodate parents.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    “We do try to accommodate parents with before or after hour meetings about our tech plans,” said Gary.
</p>
<p>
    Cynthia said, “Our Superintendent has a lot of cabinet members doing a lot of work where staff are presenting and dialoguing with parents.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Jamila Gadsen of Texas Instruments asked the panel, “What about the cost of Apps, what do schools want?”</strong>
</p>
<p>
Gary said, “We launched with six paid Apps when we launched, basics. After that teachers have to go to department heads to get what they want and then    <em>they</em> buy it. It is very hard to keep those lists up and together with the State Standards.”
</p>
<p>
    “We have somewhat the same structure,” said Cynthia. “Core Apps but individuals can also have other Apps we put in a central container for them. We have
    policies – if you download something you shouldn’t have, it’s a disciplinary issue.”
</p>
<p>
    Gary also said, “We had a lot of content filter issues with ours and we don’t allow YouTube, but at one point we had one appliance and LDAP swamped from
    thousands of students getting on at once and so had to spend $60,000 in infrastructure to recover from that.”
</p>
<p>
    <strong>David Bezzant asked about any help with deployment the districts had needed.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    “We need devices to just do what we want and not get roped into the App game and (all that deployment.)” said Gary. “We put most of our resources in the
    cloud, and we just want our content where it is needed, when it is needed. We’re into Google docs right now. We don’t want to be into managing all their
    Apps, etc.”
</p>

    right.)
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Another question from the audience was, “What about measurement?”</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Tonia said, “Well, our mission is to <em>educate</em> our students, but supporting a strong curriculum we’ve had some success and some not so good things,
    and we will be using data driven decision making going forward.”
</p>
<p>
    “We support pre and post testing,” said Cynthia.
</p>
<p>
    Gary said, “Not every test is a good test, so we’re careful, we do use testing to measure the outcomes of things, but perhaps not <em>only</em> that as a
    source of judgment about how we’re doing (as a school.)”
</p>
<p>
    This completed the panel briefing, and much thanks to the panelists Gary, Cynthia and Tonia from The Learning Counsel, and the panel leader, David Bezzant.
