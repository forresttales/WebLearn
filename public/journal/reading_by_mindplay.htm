    <strong>Aligned to Common Core Standards MindPlay Virtual Reading Coach® improves reading performance through direct instruction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Tucson, AZ, June 2014 – </strong>
Literacy publisher <a href="http://www.mindplay.com">MindPlay, Inc</a>. introduced a new upgraded version of its reading curriculum for grades K-12,    <a href="http://www.mindplay.com/programs/mindplay-virtual-reaching-coach/"><em>MindPlay Virtual Reading Coach</em>®</a> (<em>MVRC</em>). All stories
    within the Web-based <em>MVRC</em> are now assigned <em>Lexile</em>® ratings by MetaMetrics®. MindPlay's <em>Lexile </em>text complexity ratings are
    consistent with Common Core State Standards. <em>MVRC</em> helps students improve their reading skills measurably in 40 hours or less by differentiating
    instruction for each student. Using explicit and direct instruction by reading specialists and speech pathologists, students work at their own pace. The
    program helps all students improve their reading, and is appropriate for special needs, dyslexic, struggling readers, and intermediate to advanced English
    language learners.
    <br/>
    Based on years of research and successful case studies, MindPlay guarantees schools that 90 percent of students will gain at least two grade-levels of
    improvement in reading when using <em>MVRC</em> four days a week for 30 minutes each day, or MindPlay will refund their purchase. The program is now
    completely cloud-based and works on all computer platforms. Two important new reading instruction modules were added for Comprehension and Grammar as an
    aid to reading and writing. All other modules were enhanced. Additionally, there are new and improved real-time reports. Students are engaged by seven
    reading coach instructors instead of four who provide direct instruction, face to face, through photos and videos. An award-winning publisher, MindPlay has
    helped over 6 million people learn to read in its 30-year history.
</p>
<p>
    <em>MVRC</em>
    helps teachers provide direct instruction to all students. It provides virtual reading specialists and speech pathologists, who students can see and hear
    onscreen through video. <em>MVRC</em> provides instruction in six essential reading components: Phonemic Awareness, Phonics, Vocabulary, Grammar for
    Meaning, Comprehension, and Fluency.
</p>
<p>
    “For the last 30 years, I have been training special education teachers to help students who struggle to learn to read,” said Nancy Mather, Ph.D.,
    Professor of Special Education at the University of Arizona. “Ideally, every child who struggles to learn to read would have individualized daily reading
instruction by these highly trained teachers, but that isn’t possible. When I was introduced to <em>MindPlay Virtual Reading Co</em><em>ach</em> (    <em>MVRC</em>), I saw the quality and depth of this online reading program and was awestruck. I’d never considered that a computer application could
    deliver the quality individualized, evidence-based reading instruction needed to turn struggling readers into fluent readers; now I know it can!”
</p>
<p>
    “Last summer a doctoral student from the University of Arizona conducted a research study with middle school students using <em>MVRC</em>, during which the
    students made significant gains in reading. I believe that using this reading program in schools will considerably reduce the number of children who may be
    retained because they are not reading at a third-grade level.”
</p>
<p>
    <em>MVRC</em>
    automates for teachers the process of assessing reading skills and differentiating instruction. It enables all students to receive direct instruction that
    targets their specific and unique barriers to build accuracy and achieve fluent reading. The research-based program applies expert teaching methods.
    Students receive feedback targeted to help them understand and fix each error.
</p>
<p>
    Each student’s reading abilities are first assessed with MindPlay’s complete diagnostic <em>RAPS 360</em> test, and then the program instantly creates a
    prescriptive reading plan for them. Students are automatically assigned to their prescribed sequences of reading lessons and activities to begin
    immediately. While this diagnostic is now fully automated, teachers will know exactly where students need instruction. The test adapts to each student’s
    performance. This helps keep struggling readers comfortable and avoids unnecessary stress. In addition to the basic six reading components, the diagnostic
    mode also tests the effective tracking ability of students’ eyes, which is a necessary skill for reading fluency.
</p>
<p>
    <u><strong>Features</strong></u>
    <br>
    Assessment and progress monitoring are embedded into <em>MVRC</em>. In addition, the program requires students to master each skill at 100 percent before
    they move to the next lesson, to ensure they do not miss any building blocks. This builds the concrete foundation students need for learning additional
    concepts and becoming fluent readers. The program addresses students’ different styles by presenting each concept multiple ways. When students are not
    successful in learning a skill, <em>MVRC</em> teaches it again in a different way. <em>MVRC</em> includes more than 20 levels of instruction on many
    lessons, when needed, and over 40 practice activities support their learning process.
</p>
<p>
    Seven different virtual coaches and three certified speech pathologists guide students through the program and provide individualized feedback based on
    student performance. There are 44 phonemic awareness lessons, 62 phonics lessons, 40 comprehension skill lessons, and 60 grammar, meaning and writing
    lessons. Two additional modules provide students with practice in fluency and vocabulary with 30,000 vocabulary words. Students practice fluency and
    comprehension with a library of more than 1,000 different Lexiled® passages.
</p>
<p>
    Several major enhancements were made to <em>MVRC</em>’s reporting system. Two new types of reports, an Achievement Report and Parent Report, are new
    additions. <em>MVRC</em> collects and records all data into a central reporting system in real time. With the update, teachers can now see what students
    are doing instantly as it happens from the report pages. The program provides reports at district, school, classroom, and student levels. Student data can
    now be exported to a .CSV file, which can be imported into <em>Excel</em>. Teachers and administrators can customize and export the reports they need to
    evaluate student progress.
</p>
<p>
    <u><strong>Instructional Modules</strong></u>
    <br/>
    <em>MVRC</em>
    ’s six instructional reading modules provide interactive, multiple learning style activities that help students stay focused and accelerate their progress.
    Four of these modules are updated and two are new:
</p>
<p>
    1. <strong>Phonemic Awareness</strong> includes explicit and systematic instruction on the blending of sounds into words and segmentation of words into
    their individual sounds, essential steps in learning to read, write, and spell.
</p>
<p>
    2. <strong>Phonics</strong> instruction is systematic, explicit and differentiated for sound-symbol relationships, long and short vowels, consonant
    digraphs, diphthongs, blends, syllable types, Latin and Greek roots. Students learn how to easily decode new words. Students learn the spelling pattern and
practice each assigned lesson with mastery-based activities. Students are only assigned lessons that they need as determined by the placement test.    <strong> </strong>Students experience a variety of different modalities as four of 12 activities are assigned based on lesson content.
</p>
<p>
    3. The <strong>Vocabulary</strong> module includes over 30,000 words. Seven learning activities help students work on listening vocabulary skills. Students
    learn five related words at a time to expand their knowledge of words, roots, and affixes to derive word meaning from context.
</p>
<p>
    4. <strong>Grammar for Meaning</strong> uses parts of speech to teach students how sentences are constructed for meaning. Students learn not to skip words
    when reading and to understand the function of each word, by encouraging them to form pictures in their minds. Pre and post testing of grammar skills from
    this module is also new and now active. The review test will assess the skills only in that set and will reassign lessons in that set only if needed.
</p>
<p>
    5. <strong>Fluency</strong> systematically increases silent reading speed while ensuring proficient reading comprehension. With over 1,000 original stories
in the Fluency library, the questions were completely revised to meet the Common Core Standards. Each story grades 2 to 12 has been assigned a text    <em>Lexile</em>® as determined by MetaMetrics®. The text genre is selected randomly between expository and narrative. Each student begins the module with
    text slightly below their diagnosed reading grade level to comfortably ease into the program. Speed and practice is adapted to meet the needs of the
    learners. The words per minute rate will increase by 10 wpm from story to story based on successful comprehension. The speed will not increase unless the
    student comprehends the text. This module now uses the Dolch List of high-frequency words for the Word Match activity. This activity enables students to
    recognize these words with automaticity.
</p>
<p>
    6. The <strong>Comprehension</strong> module, the second of the two new instructional modules added to <em>MVRC</em>, directly teaches almost 40 different
    reading comprehension skills and strategies. Comprehension questions are triggered by the questions a student misses in the Fluency stories. So a student
    only gets lessons that are needed. This is a mastery-based component that uses a new and dedicated virtual coach to teach a single objective. Instruction
    is scaffolded and differentiated as needed by each student. Questioning aligns with the Common Core State Standards reading skills. Some of the skills
    addressed include: summarizing and paraphrasing, author’s purpose, main idea, and comparing and contrasting.
