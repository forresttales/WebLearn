<p>
    NORTH BILLERICA, Mass., August 21, 2014—The Enlarged City School District of Middletown, a National Race to the Top District (RTTT-D) in Middletown, NY, has improved student outcomes through its use of Curriculum Associates’ <a href="http://www.i-ready.com/empower" target="_blank">i-Ready® Diagnostic & Instruction.</a> During the first year of its blended learning initiative in 2013–14, the district implemented the online program, which is built for the Common Core State Standards, in 33 elementary classrooms. Middletown chose i-Ready to meet its academic needs based on a collaborative design and content selection process that involved district leaders, teachers, and its partner, Education Elements, which helps design and implement personalized learning plans for districts.
</p>
<p>
    Through the use of i-Ready, teachers in the district have been able to personalize instruction using data from the adaptive diagnostic, helping to make a shift toward prescriptive instruction for students that includes the use of online instruction. As a result, more than 70% of students using i-Ready progressed more than one grade level in one year in reading, and more than 50% of students progressed more than one grade level in math.  
</p>
<p>
    “<span style="font-style:italic;">i-Ready is a powerful addition to our digital content library. With i-Ready, each teacher has the power to administer a diagnostic assessment to determine students’ strengths and weaknesses. As a result of this diagnostic assessment, every student is then provided with an adaptive instructional path that addresses their strengths and weaknesses. Instructional environments have to provide students with a personalized experience and i-Ready helps us to do this,</span>” said Amy Creeden, Principal of the Race to the Top Grant at Enlarged City School District of Middletown.
</p>
<p>
    i-Ready is proven to help students make real gains by combining a valid and reliable adaptive diagnostic with personalized student online instruction and teacher-led instruction in a single online product. The adaptive diagnostic pinpoints student needs down to the sub-skill level and generates a combination of rigorous and engaging online instruction and downloadable teacher-led lessons that are unique to each student’s diagnostic result, in addition to providing targeted skill practice through mobile apps. The individualized instructional plans are easy to understand, differentiate instruction, and support blending learning.
</p>
<p>
    “<span style="font-style:italic;">i-Ready provides schools and districts with a comprehensive online assessment and instructional program that is proven to improve student outcomes,” said Rob Waldron, CEO of Curriculum Associates. “Middletown exemplifies how the program, when used with fidelity by an individual student or in small or large groups as part of a blended learning environment, can truly drive student achievement and positively impact teaching and learning.</span>”
</p>
<p>
	Education Elements worked with Middletown to help the district select the best digital content for its students and selected i-Ready as part of that process. Students access i-Ready content and teachers access i-Ready data through Highlight, Education Elements' personalized learning platform.
</p>
<p>
	“<span style="font-style:italic;">Education Elements uses a unique, rigorous process to evaluate the efficacy of our partners' products before they become part of our ecosystem. Our educators review and match each provider to our clients and their individual needs to make sure there is an appropriate product fit," said Anthony Kim, CEO of Education Elements. “We are excited to see the impact i-Ready is having on student achievement at Middletown. It demonstrates that when you match the right product to students’ and teachers’ needs, great things happen.</span>"
