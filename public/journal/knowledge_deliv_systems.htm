    Knowledge Delivery Systems Teams Up with Pacific Educational Group to Offer 
Groundbreaking Courageous Conversations About Race Course

 
</div>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
	<p style="font-size: 20px; font-style: italic;">Renowned racial equity expert Glenn Singleton, and his leadership team provide educators with 
a protocol that facilitates meaningful and transformative discussions on race
</p>
<div class="space"></div>

<p>
    NEW YORK, NEW YORK – Knowledge Delivery Systems (KDS), a leading provider of strategic and blended professional learning solutions for states and school districts in collaboration with Pacific Educational Group (PEG) has announced today that it is offering a course to support educators in their effort to eliminate racial disparities through conversations that explore the intersection of race and education. 
 </p>
<p>
Racial tensions arise often in school settings and need to be addressed to eliminate racial achievement disparities. In diverse settings, schools and districts struggle to discuss race and address the continuance of racial dominance in schools. The result of these unspoken challenges can result in schools struggling to connect as a community, engage all learners, and empower their staff to be effective. 
 </p>
<p>
To address the racial disparities, KDS and PEG’s new online course, “Courageous Conversations About Race” was developed exclusively for PreK-12 grade educators who want to become culturally and socially responsive to the needs of all students and especially students of color. 
 </p>
<p>
This course will support districts by engaging them in meaningful conversations across racial groups using a protocol for ongoing discourse about race.<br/> 
The course will feature:
 </p>
<p style="font-type:italic; font-size:20px; padding-left:25px;">
High quality videos of teachers discussing and using courageous conversation protocol<br/> 
Educator testimonials and interviews<br/>
Video instruction and narration by author/content expert<br/>
Interactive activities to engage learners with the content<br/>
Chapter readings to build foundational knowledge and deepen understanding<br/>
Reflection prompts and discussion questions that address issues of racial dominance<br/>
 </p>
<p>
“Never before have we been able to intimately address issues of racial disparity in education. But now, through our latest partnership with Pacific Educational Group, we are excited to offer a technology-based solution that is not only time and cost effective but can help districts to scale this important work, ” said Alvin Crawford, CEO of KDS. “Courageous Conversations About Race can effectively build a common language, develop meaningful conversations, build bridges and foster understanding about the impact of race.”  
 </p>
<p>
“In order to equitably serve every student regardless of their race or ethnicity, it is imperative that schools strengthen interracial understanding, trust and discourse,” said Glenn Singleton, President and Founder of Pacific Educational Group. “When educators engage in courageous conversations about race, they develop valuable relationships with their students and become a catalyst for inspiring student engagement and performance.”
