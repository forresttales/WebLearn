    Apperson’s Evo Academic and Evo Social &amp; Emotional 
Finalists in the 2015 SIIA CODiE Awards

<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
	<p style="font-size: 20px; font-style: italic;">Online K-12 assessment programs recognized in two education categories</p>
<div class="space"></div>

<p>
    Charlotte, N.C. – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apperson.com/k12/assessments/apperson-evo/evo-academic">Evo Academic</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apperson.com/k12/assessments/apperson-evo/evo-social-emotional">Evo Social &amp; Emotional Learning</a> (SEL), both Apperson Evo modules, were named finalists in the 2015 Software &amp; Information Industry Association (SIIA) CODiE Awards, the premier awards for the software and information industries. Evo Academic was chosen in the Best K-12 Course or Learning Management Solution category and Evo SEL was chosen in the Best Instructional Solution in Other Curriculum Areas.
 </p>
<p>
The SIIA CODiE Awards have more than 85 categories and are organized by industry focus of Content, Education, and Software. The Best K-12 Course or Learning Management Solution category recognizes the best digital learning system to manage curriculum-based content, student access and use, diagnostic and remediation programs, data management and reporting tools for K-12 educators while the Best Instructional Solution in Other Curriculum Areas recognizes the best application focusing on non-core curriculum areas for students in the PreK-12 or postsecondary market.
 </p>
<p>
“To be recognized by the industry-leading SIIA CODiE Awards validates our mission to help schools have a positive impact on every aspect of a child’s learning, from academic to social/emotional,” said Bill Apperson, chairman of the board of Apperson. “Today’s educators face enormous pressures to provide individualized learning for students. Apperson platforms help educators transform assessment data into actionable information to meet the needs of all learners.”
 </p>
<p>
Evo Academic enables educators to create and deliver assessments either online or in paper form and then access this assessment data in the cloud. Educators who use bubble answer sheets can scan these into Evo Academic’s online interface. The system also encourages collaboration by allowing educators to share effective questions and assessments with their colleagues.
 </p>
<p>
The Evo SEL is an assessment system that allows educators and after school providers to measure social and emotional competence, school achievement and lifelong success in order to focus on students’ SEL skills development.  The system is based on the Devereux Student Strengths Assessment (DESSA), an assessment designed to identify students who are at risk for overall social emotional difficulties.   
 </p>
<p>
“This year’s finalists are breaking ground with new business models and innovative products. We are pleased to recognize the best in educational technology with these 157 products,” said Karen Billings, vice president and managing director of the ETIN-SIIA. “I look forward to honoring them all in May at the Education Industry Summit.”
 </p>
<p>
The SIIA CODiE Awards have been recognizing product excellence for 29 years. This year’s program features 28 Education categories, several of which are new or updated to reflect the latest industry trends and business models. Winners will be announced during a special awards dinner at the Education Industry Summit in San Francisco on May 5, 2015.
