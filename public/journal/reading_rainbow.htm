<p>
    <strong>LOS ANGELES, CA &amp; GREENSBORO, NC – February 18, 2014 – Reading Rainbow </strong>
    and<strong> Kindermusik International</strong>,<strong> </strong>two of the most trusted brands in childhood education, today announced a partnership that
    combines Kindermusik International’s research-based musical learning curriculum with Reading Rainbow’s award-winning mobile reading service in a digital
    library available on tablet devices. New digital content will launch March 2, 2014, in time for Music in our Schools Month (MIOSM), and National Read
    Across America Day (RAAD).
</p>
<p>
    “This partnership with Kindermusik emphasizes the important, proven connection between literacy and music,” said LeVar Burton, RRKidz/Reading Rainbow
    co-founder. “We know that when young children are engaged by music in age-appropriate ways, they can build skills that are the foundation for reading. By
    integrating the other arts and sciences, we aim to further inspire a lifelong love of learning.”
</p>
<p>
    Reading Rainbow’s tablet-based reading service, hosted by Burton, guides children on a reading adventure to themed “islands,” each filled with hundreds of
    children’s books and video field trips. More than ten million books have been read and video field trips viewed since the mid-2012 launch. With the
    addition of Music Mountain Island, Kindermusik’s music-themed books and videos will be featured alongside other newly produced content from Reading Rainbow
    and their acclaimed partners.
</p>
<p>
    “Our collaboration with Reading Rainbow reinforces what our own experience and the growing body of research clearly states, that there is a clear tie
    between music and literacy and language development,” explained Michael Dougherty, CEO at Kindermusik International. “We are thrilled to put our
    research-based content into some of the best development hands and are excited this new content area within Reading Rainbow will arrive in time to
    celebrate Music in Our Schools Month.”
</p>
<p>
    While the partnership between these two brands is new, the links between music and reading are not. Research has shown music supports a child’s literacy
development in many ways, including phonological awareness, vocabulary building, listening skills, reading accuracy, and prosody. Results from a 2012-2013    <a href="http://media.kindermusik.com/docs/PDF/ABCMusicMeEffectivenessSummary-FINAL.pdf">study</a> of nearly 300 preschool children by independent research
firm, SEG Measurement, indicated that students who utilized Kindermusik’s    <a href="http://www.kindermusik.com/schools/early-literacy-curriculum/">ABC Music &amp; Me</a> curriculum for just 30 minutes each week showed greater
    gains in literacy. The treatment group who utilized the music and movement curriculum showed a 32% higher gain in Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening
    (PALS) scores over the control group.
</p>
<p>
    The Music Mountain Island featuring Kindermusik’s content will be available in the Reading Rainbow app and the Kindle Fire app by March 2, 2014. The app is
    free to try and for an unlimited reading experience, parents can subscribe for $9.99 per month or $29.99 for a six-month subscription. Additional
information about the Reading Rainbow iPad app can be found by visiting the iTunes App Store    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reading-rainbow/id512350210?mt=8">here</a>.
