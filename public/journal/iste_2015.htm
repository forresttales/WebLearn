   WASHINGTON, D.C. – May 21, 2015 – High school students from Philadelphia’s Science Leadership Academy (SLA) will open the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.isteconference.org/2015/?id=94479753.">Lead & Transform: An ISTE Town Hall</a> event at the 2015 conference of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iste.org/">International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE&reg;)</a>. The students will join influential educators from around the country to discuss how distributed leadership can transform classrooms into high-performing, connected learning and teaching environments. The ISTE 2015 Lead & Transform Town Hall will take place on Sunday, June 28, 9–11:30 a.m. in Philadelphia. 

“Leading through times of transformation presents unique challenges,” said Brian Lewis, ISTE CEO. “And all educators, regardless of our role, are leaders. That means we all play a part in meeting the ever-changing needs of our students while advancing our learning and teaching practices. The town hall will be a great opportunity to engage in a dynamic discussion of what it takes to achieve full-scale, sustainable change.”

Following the student perspective, S. Dallas Dance, superintendent, Baltimore County Public Schools and ISTE board member, will moderate a panel of ed tech leaders who will discuss the professional learning models they are implementing in their districts and what’s on the horizon as they ensure that they remain future-ready.
