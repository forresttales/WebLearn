<p>
    (SAN DIEGO) Aug. 19, 2015 - To help students and teachers make the transition to Common Core State Standards, <a href="http://blog.learningupgrade.com" target="_blank">Learning Upgrade</a> is offering 100,000 complimentary student licenses to schools nationwide. Administrators and teachers can enroll each licensed student into any of Learning Upgrade’s Common Core aligned courses.
</p>
<p>
    The new courses for grades K-8 were designed and created after the standards were released, ensuring each benchmark is addressed appropriately. Through <a href="http://blog.learningupgrade.com" target="_blank">engaging songs, video, and games,</a> the interactive lessons help struggling students catch up on previous year standards, master current grade level standards, and perform well on the new computer-based year-end tests.
</p>
<p>
    "Going back to school can be a stressful time for students, teachers and even parents. When you add transitioning to the Common Core into the mix, it's downright overwhelming," said Vinod Lobo, the founder of Learning Upgrade. "We want to make sure every student in America is equipped for success, and we feel that offering complimentary access to our full curriculum is a step in the right direction.”
</p>
<p>
    Learning Upgrade’s new courses are designed with the Common Core State Standards in mind. Each grade-specific course features <a href="http://blog.learningupgrade.com/courses" target="_blank">60 interactive lessons</a>, covering every standard for that grade. Teachers can quickly integrate the lessons into their classes using a simple one-page alignment, and can track every student’s progress on every standard with a graphical student monitor.
</p>
<p>
    Educators from U.S. schools with at least 300 students who would like to take advantage of this offer should visit <a href="http://learningupgrade.com" target="_blank">www.learningupgrade.com</a>. Select “<strong>Start Free Trial</strong>,” then sign up for the school free trial.  Qualifying schools will receive a 20-student license for the 2014-15 school year at no cost.
