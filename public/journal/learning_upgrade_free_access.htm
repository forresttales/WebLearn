<p>
    (SAN DIEGO)—For the third year, Learning Upgrade is offering complimentary “Summer School” access to its web-based Common Core aligned curriculum to all
    qualifying U.S. schools and districts. The company looks to support districts in their quest to halt the dreaded summer slide, without putting a burden on
    their budget.
</p>
<p>
    Through the incorporation of songs, video, games and extensive educational research, Learning Upgrade has helped thousands of students reach and exceed
    grade level requirements in both Math and English Language Arts. The complimentary summer licenses provide users full access to all of Learning Upgrade’s
    K-8 courses, including the newly released Math Upgrade 6 Common Core lessons.
</p>
<p>
    Learning Upgrade’s intuitive platform provides students with immediate feedback as well as additional support and remediation when and where students need
    it. Once a student has demonstrated mastery of a given skill, they are automatically advanced to the next lesson.
</p>
<p>
    “Combating the summer slide is a very real challenge for school and district leaders across the country, we know they are looking for resources that will
    engage their students, but won’t break the bank,” said Vinod Lobo, Learning Upgrade CEO and co-founder. “Over the past three years, Learning Upgrade has
    offered completely free licenses to schools or districts looking for resources that will support their students over the summer. The feedback we have
    received in past years has been so overwhelmingly positive, we have expanded our program for the upcoming summer.”
</p>
<p>
    Research from the National Summer Learning Association shows that, without refreshing their memories, students may lose up to two months of grade-level
    equivalency over the summer.
</p>
<p>
    Many summer school participants use Learning Upgrade courses to ensure new, incoming students are prepared for the upcoming school year. The company sees
    many middle schools use their Math Upgrade 5 courses to ensure incoming sixth graders are at or above grade level by the start of school. Reports provide
    teachers with insight in to each student’s gaps and needs for additional support.
</p>
<p>
    Each web-based course from Learning Upgrade can be used within a summer school setting or at home. The platform allows teachers to quickly and easily track
    individual student progress over the summer and provide immediate feedback to parents and students through web-based reports.
</p>

    the information box, and include the number of student licenses you need.
