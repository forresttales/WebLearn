    Curriculum Associates Expands Ready&reg; Mathematics to Further Help Students Master the Rigor of New Standards

	Two new resources further develop conceptual understanding, problem-solving strategies, and procedural fluency

<p>
    NORTH BILLERICA, Mass. — Curriculum Associates has expanded its Ready® Mathematics program to include a student Practice and Problem Solving Book, as well as online Math Center Activities for grades 2–5, to help students further develop conceptual understanding, problem-solving strategies, and procedural fluency. The Ready program now provides teachers with more classroom activities as well as options for rigorous, independent student practice in class, after school, or at home.
</p>
<p>
    “It is essential for students to receive rigorous math practice—both at school and at home—so that they gain confidence in their skills and successfully meet the expectations of the new standards,” said Rob Waldron, CEO of Curriculum Associates. “Now with the new additions to the Ready Common Core Mathematics program, students have even more opportunities to strengthen their higher-order thinking skills to solve complex problems and make real progress toward their math goals.”  
</p>
<p>
    The Mathematics Practice and Problem Solving Book complements the Student Instruction Book and includes:
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
    	<li>A family letter for every lesson that helps parents or caregivers understand the content and participate in the lesson activity with their child</li>

		<li>Problems that require greater levels of higher-order thinking and encourage students to reason and explain their thinking</li>

		<li>Performance tasks that require students to integrate concepts and skills from multiple standards within the unit to solve a multi-step problem</li>

		<li>Unit games that provide opportunities for students to work collaboratively as they build fluency and deepen conceptual understanding. The new Math Center Activities, available within Ready’s Online Teacher Toolbox, further reinforce the program’s instructional and practice components. There are two activities providing differentiated instruction for each standard, and each activity is differentiated for students performing on-level, below-level, and above-level. The activities can be used by teachers to differentiate instruction or by students either individually or in small groups without direct teacher involvement, which make the activities ideal for use as part of a classroom rotation or for use in tutoring centers.</li>
    </ul>
