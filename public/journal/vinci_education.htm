    VINCI EDUCATION ANNOUNCES NEW VIRTUAL SCHOOL FOR TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS

<p>
    BOSTON - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vincieducation.com/online/">VINCI Education</a>, the technology-powered education company that has revolutionized the way young children and parents approach early learning, is breaking new ground again with the first virtual school for toddlers and preschoolers that also provides virtual certified teachers and free tablets.
</p>
<p>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vincigenius.com">Class VINCI Home</a> is the new program offered by VINCI Virtual School. It builds upon and extends the company's already successful school solution, which recently won a Tech & Learning 2014 Award of Excellence and an SIIA 2014 CODiE Award for the Best Game-based Learning Curriculum. The company already operates schools and daycare centers that adopt the same blended learning solution, offering young children a "Happy Environment" where rigor and high expectations are not compromised.
</p>
<p>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vincigenius.com">The Class VINCI Home</a> Gold and Platinum level of enrollment offers certified, virtual teachers to spend time with each individual child, evaluate their progress and offer assistance to parents.
</p>
<p>
   The top three levels of enrollment also operate on the VINCI tablet to provide content management support for parents. 
</p>

<p>
    "Children who do well in school start off doing well in kindergarten. Their success comes from the confidence they develop in their very early years of learning and growing," said Dr. Dan Yang, founder and CEO of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vincieducation.com/online/">VINCI Education</a>. "There are key skills that each child needs in order to succeed in school. ClassVINCI simply makes those skills visible and helps children to gain these skills one at the time."
</p>
<p>
    As part of the Virtual School program parents receive skill-driven digital games and books plus weekly lesson plans complete with a variety of lists of activities for tactile learning.  VINCI Virtual School's Class VINCI <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vincigenius.com/">Home</a> program works on either VINCI tablets or other Android tablets powered by a 3rd party.  An iPad version is expected in February 2015. Only VINCI tablets enabled parents to automatically manage digital content and connect to learning assessment. For a limited time, when parents enroll in the Silver, Gold, or Platinum packages they will receive the accompanying VINCI tablet for free.
</p>
<p>
	Each weekly lesson has a theme, objective, sensory/tactile exercises and music songs or videos that parents can do with their children. There is also a special "VINCI Little Book" connected to the theme for parents to read to their children, a digital game-based lesson and questions that can help parents assess whether their children fully understand the concept.  VINCI Virtual School classes start officially on Jan. 12, 2015, while tablets will be delivered to families during the holiday season. 
</p>
<p>
	"Less struggle and minimum stress around a child's education can only be achieved through early planning and preparation. And that's what ClassVINCI Home is designed for," Yang said.
</p>
<p>
	The enrollment for the virtual school starts now. The free tablet offer is available until Dec. 21, 2014. For more information visit: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vincigenius.com/">www.vincigenius.com</a>.
