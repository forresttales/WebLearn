    Desert District Goes Fully Digital
</div>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<div class="title-3" align="left" style="font-style:italic;">The Learning Counsel Speaks with Superintendent Dr. Darryl Adams About His Digital Curriculum Strategy and Transforming a Poor California Desert District to A Leader in Education Innovation.</div><br/>
<p class="author-date">By: Cebron Walker, the Learning Counsel</p>
<div class="space"></div>
 
<p>
	On Thursday, May 28th Superintendent of Coachella Valley Unified School District, Dr. Darryl Adams spoke with the Learning Counsel on the work that’s been done and is still underway in his district to ready his students for the 21st century work-a-day world.
	</p>
<p>
From becoming the first district in the nation to place 20,000 tablets into the hands of every student from Pre-K to high school, to equipping all school busses with WiFi, Coachella Valley is leading the charge, utilizing technology to transform education for today’s students.
</p>
<p>
The district’s strategy was even recognized by President Obama in his ConnectED speech last November, in particular their 24/7 use of school busses to keep students and their families connected.
</p>

“This is really smart,” the President said. “You’ve got underutilized resources, buses in the evening, so you put the routers on, disperse them, and suddenly everybody is connected,” he said during the speech. “Now it’s not just students that can get online. It’s their families as well.”
</p>
<p>
Take a look at our spotlight video this week with Dr. Adams. You’ll get a good understanding of what he is doing and how he did it. In his own words, “Our district faces some very tough challenges in educating the children of the Coachella Valley. We remain convinced that we can and will continue to improve our educational outcomes so that more of our students go on to college and become respected and respectful members of our diverse global society. Education is the ticket to the future and we are working diligently to make sure that we provide students with opportunities to excel and to prosper.”
