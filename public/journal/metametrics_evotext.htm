    MetaMetrics and EvoText Announce Partnership to Help Teachers Build Lessons Using Appropriate Text Complexity
</div>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<div class="space"></div>

<p>
    ORLANDO, Florida - MetaMetrics&reg;, developer of the widely adopted <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lexile.com/">Lexile&reg; Framework for Reading</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.evotext.com/">and EvoText, LLC</a>, a provider of custom eLearning solutions for schools and educational publishers, announced today that they have partnered to incorporate MetaMetrics’ Lexile&reg; Analyzer technology into <a target="_blank" href="http://www.getogment.com/">Ogment&#8482;</a>.  Ogment, an EvoText product that is being previewed at FETC 2015, is a cloud-based K-12 lesson creation tool for teachers. 
</p>
<p>
     With Ogment, teachers can clip articles, videos and other relevant content from websites and then use that content to build interactive lessons. “Teachers are already using the web to turn everyday content into educational material—Ogment just facilitates that process,” said Johanna Wetmore, CEO of EvoText and cofounder of Ogment. With the click of a button, a teacher can bring an article or any piece of text from a website into Ogment, and the Lexile Analyzer will instantaneously provide an approximate Lexile measure for that text.  
</p>
<p>
	“We are very excited to be working with MetaMetrics to bring this technology into Ogment. Teachers from all subjects, not just ELA and Reading, are increasingly being made responsible for covering literacy standards in their curriculum. It’s extremely helpful for teachers to have instant access to a reading passage’s Lexile level right at point of use,” said Wetmore. “With this powerful tool, teachers can now make more informed decisions about which materials they use in their classrooms,” she continued.
</p>
<p>
	The Lexile Analyzer evaluates the complexity of the text by breaking down the entire piece and studying its characteristics, such as sentence length and word frequency, which represent the syntactic and semantic challenges that the text presents to a reader. The outcome is the text complexity, expressed as a Lexile® measure, along with information on the word count, mean sentence length and mean log frequency. Most text receives a Lexile measure between 200L to 1700L, although the Lexile scale extends below 0L for beginning reader texts to above 2000L for advanced texts.
</p>
<p>
	“We are delighted to partner with an innovator like EvoText,” stated Malbert Smith, Ph.D., president and cofounder of MetaMetrics. “A lesson creation tool like Ogment and its ability to generate relevant, engaging and ability appropriate content will be a tremendous asset to teachers everywhere. We are excited that the Lexile technology will be included in Ogment and be part of the equation to deliver students more personalized instruction that will help them grow in their abilities and thrive in life.”
