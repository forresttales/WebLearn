    Initiative Leverages State-of-the-art Technology Using Apex Learning Digital Curriculum 
</div>
<div style="height: 10px;"></div>



<p align="CENTER">
    <strong>SEATTLE, WA — The Metropolitan School District of Warren Township, a suburban school district in Indianapolis and a recipient of a Race to the Top Grant, implemented a new district-wide one-to-one initiative that provides Chromebooks to all students and staff.  Partnering with <a href="http://www.apexlearning.com/" target="_blank">Apex Learning</a> to provide teachers with digital curriculum that meets diverse student needs, the district is redefining the traditional education paradigm with the new initiative</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Access to technology coupled with a flexible, comprehensive digital curriculum is providing new, motivating options for students to meet graduation requirements. 
</p>
<p>
    "<span style="font-style: italic;">Our goal was to implement a curriculum that provides students with new methods of exploring, testing and applying their knowledge in a format that excites and motivates them,</span>” said John Keller, the director of instructional technology and eLearning for the district.
</p>
<p>
    Offering both Comprehensive Courses and modular Tutorials to meet individual student needs, Apex Learning digital curriculum is an instrumental piece of the district’s one-to-one learning program. Comprehensive Courses for original credit and credit recovery and Tutorials for targeted instruction address a variety of instructional needs. 
</p>
<p>
    Leveraging technology made available through the one-to-one Chromebook initiative empowers each student to determine how and when learning takes place. Students can complete coursework on campus or remotely through the district’s virtual school program.  
</p>
<p>
    “<span style="font-style: italic;">We are at a critical juncture in how we engage students in learning,</span>” said Keller, “<span style="font-style: italic;">We want to extend learning opportunities beyond the traditional classroom. Apex Learning digital curriculum enables teachers to engage one-to-one with their students in ways previously not possible, offering new options for supporting students with a wide range of needs.</span>”
