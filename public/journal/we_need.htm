    One recent article at <a href="http://www.techlearning.com/features/0039/defining-digital-curriculum/54112">Tech &amp; Learning Magazine</a> interviewed
    various school technology leaders to ask them about defining digital curriculum. Mostly what was talked about was pretty broad. Please also see our article
    on <a href="/archives/show?id=1011">5 Types of Curriculum Things</a> addressing the creation of some major categories. In the course of the last five years I have also been in
    many conversations with school and publisher leadership about “what” digital curriculum is and is not.
</p>
<p>
    What we need is some new words to encapsulate what’s happening and allow us to communicate more completely.
</p>
<p>
    Let’s see about creating some new words out of the old words and their roots. Let’s take these categories:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Words that describe what: </strong>
		    digital, curriculum, element, content, book, video, app, data, lesson, work, labor, test, assessment, text, game, software, computer, multi-media, mobile, sport
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Words that describe the creation:</strong>
            publish, write, develop, mobilize, digitize, design, fashioned, execute, pattern, devise, contrive, convey, intend, impose, communicate, give,
            tender, transfer, source,
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Words that describe the action:</strong>
            social, activity, compute, visual, touch, correlate, relate, include, inclusion, collaborate, reason, thought, think, absorb, cognate, cognition,
            recognize, recognition, recreation, jinks, revelry, play, study, transmit, distribute
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Words that describe the outcome:</strong>
            virtual, impart, social, assess, test, impart, receive, learn, individualized, personalized, collaborative, transmit, pathway, matrix, correlation, 
            literacy, knowledge, understanding, awareness, transform, -erati (as in literati)
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    All of these things, and probably more, are part of what’s happening with digital curriculum. They all describe some aspect of what’s going on with it.
</p>
<p>
    How about if we play with some of these as a mash-up of their meanings to come up with new words to anchor in new ways the world of digital curriculum?

        was really impigiting the math students. He was the only teacher that could impigitate biology with just mobile tablets, all the other teachers still

</p>
<p>
    Let us know what you think! Are there other words you can extrapolate out of the ones above? Others that are needed?
</p>
<p>
    Let’s start a communication revolution to accompany what we are doing to revolutionize education with technology.
