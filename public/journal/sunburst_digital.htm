    Sunburst Digital Enters Into Partnership With Parlor Labs
</div>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>

<p>
   Hoffman Estates, IL - Sunburst Digital, Inc. and Parlor Labs announced a new partnership today designed to bring Ponder, a browser add-on and iOS app used to create micro-responses and annotations, to schools and districts across the nation.
 </p>
<p>
Ponder is the first cloud-based “micro-response” and annotation tool that gives teachers a view into the invisible process of learning through higher-order critical thinking.  Teachers and students are using Ponder to manage open-ended, self-directed learning across the Web, PDFs, and videos.  Real-time radar provides teachers with an aggregated and visualized dashboard view of how students respond to a reading or video.
 </p>
<p>
Higher-order thinking through inquiry based learning is often one of the hardest skills to teach students.  With Ponder, learning happens when students figure out how to ask questions, not answer them.  Ponder allows students to engage directly with assigned content, interest level readings, and their peers to create a collaborative setting that explicitly encourages them to think about what they are sharing in terms of how interesting it will be to their peers as well as the relevancy to classroom discussion.
 </p>
<p>
Ken Leonard, chairman and CEO at Sunburst Digital commented, “We are excited to enter into a partnership with Parlor Labs an organization dedicated to creating a social reading experience that both expands the breadth of what our students are reading as well as deepens their understanding of how we engage with the world around us.” 
 </p>
<p>
<strong>About Parlor Labs</strong><br/>
 Parlor Labs is the creator of Ponder, the micro-response platform.  Ponder is the result of ongoing collaborations with researchers and educators around the question of how to promote higher order literacy both in the classroom and beyond.  Ponder’s patent-pending scaffold has been shown by an independent controlled study to substantially boost student engagement and improve the quality of in-class discussions and student work.  Parlor Labs’ broader mission is to generate and visualize thoughtful data that educators can apply to their daily teaching practice in real-time.
