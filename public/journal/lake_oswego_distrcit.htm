    Lake Oswego School District Embraces Data Visualization Platform for Decision Making
</div>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<div style="font-style: italic; font-size: 22px;" align="center">Award winning Lake Oswego School District chooses GuideK12, geovisual analytics software</div>
<div class="space"></div>

<p>
    Eagan, MN  – Administrators at Lake Oswego School District selected GuideK12’s cloud-based solution to enable district analysis and strategic planning with a geographic perspective.  The team from Lake Oswego School District, led by Superintendent Dr. Heather Beck, was impressed by the insight administrators can gain when data is visualized in an interactive format that allows for real time scenarios to be run by those closest to decisions.
</p>
<p>
    ZipRealty named Lake Oswego Public Schools as a standout school district this past summer and a top performing school district that offers affordable housing.  This prestigious honor sets the bar high for community members and brings with it anticipated growth and interest from prospective families. With growth and expansion comes difficult decisions for administrators regarding the best ways to expand.
</p>
<p>
    GuideK12, geovisual analytics, allows a district to see their data with a new lens for smart resource placement, planning, and proactive decision-making, well suited for an evolving district in demand.
</p>
<p>
    “GuideK12 will help Lake Oswego address a number of challenges.  It will allow us to look at the ideal location for special programs that meet student’s needs, help us better understand shifts in district demographics, analyze boundary scenarios and make it easier for parents to find information on assigned schools. Ultimately it is about making solid, data-driven decisions with a geographic perspective,” stated Dr. Heather Beck, Lake Oswego’s new superintendent. “In the future I imagine using GuideK12 to share data with the community as it is much easier to see and understand data as a picture rather than charts or spreadsheets.”
</p>
<p>
    GuideK12&#8482; is a web-based platform that assists school and district leaders in solving critical educational challenges by visualizing data on an interactive map.   Included in the GuideK12 suite of products is GuideK12 SchoolSearch, an address search tool for the community to find their assigned schools as well as more advanced customized search features for program selections. 
</p>
<p>
	Superintendent Beck shared the Lake Oswego Administration’s excitement about this new tool when she spoke with chamber of commerce members, realtors and community members regarding the power of 24/7 access to GuideK12SchoolSearch online as the tool allows community members, and realtors to quickly confirm which school is associated with a home address and speeds up the process for realtors while reducing calls for the district. 
</p>
<p>
	 “We are proud to partner with Lake Oswego as it leads the way in the Portland area with GuideK12.  Dr. Beck embraces the importance of utilizing data to make more informed and supported decisions. We are excited to be a part of the Lake Oswego District strategic toolset,” said GuideK12 CEO, Chuck Amos.
