    Two schools achieve learning success with free math and reading licenses
Learning Upgrade offers free access to online curriculum

<p>
    SAN DIEGO — If your students need support in math and reading but your district doesn’t have the budget to provide more resources, what can you do?
</p>
<p>
    Two schools – one junior high and one elementary school – have come up with a creative solution to this common problem. They’re using free licenses offered by <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.learningupgrade.com/">Learning Upgrade</a>, an online curriculum with catchy songs and engaging videos to teach students math and reading skills.
</p>
<p>
    “I used to struggle with motivating my students to stay focused during math and reading lessons,” said Nadine Stewart, an ELA teacher at Emily Watkins Elementary in LaPlace, La. “Now they constantly ask me if we’re going to the computer lab so they can use Learning Upgrade. They enjoy the immediate feedback that teachers cannot always give right away. It has really helped me to help my students get their gap skills covered in an educational and entertaining way.”
</p>
<p>
    Sandra Siqueiros, a 7th grade math teacher at Poston Junior High in Mesa, Ariz., has also had success with the online lessons, but with a different population of students.
</p>
<p>
    “My gifted students love using the program to get ahead! They are competing with each other to see who can gain access to the next level the fastest,” said Siqueiros. “Having a little healthy competition has been wonderful.”
</p>
<p>
	Not only did her students love the program, Siqueiros saw impressive learning growth for her students on <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.learningupgrade.com/">Learning Upgrade</a>. While the median growth percentile on math scores for the entire junior high school was 55, Siqueiros’ class had a median growth percentile of 84.5.
</p>
<p>
	For the team at Learning Upgrade, results like this validate their decision to offer free licenses to schools.
</p>
<p>
	“Great EdTech doesn’t need a huge price tag. We want every student to have access to the most engaging online math and reading lessons available, regardless of their district’s budget,” said Vinod Lobo, the co-founder of Learning Upgrade. “Hearing these stories from Poston Junior High and Emily Watkins Elementary is so encouraging to everyone at Learning Upgrade, and we hope to continue seeing the same results in other districts.”
</p>
<p>
	<a target="_blank" href="http://blog.learningupgrade.com/freetrial/">Learning Upgrade offers free 20-student licenses</a> to U.S. schools with 300 or more students. Teachers can enroll students into any of the Math Upgrade and English Upgrade courses, which feature songs, video, and games to bring students up to proficiency. One teacher license is included for whole-class interactive musical lessons.
</p>
