    Sangari Active Science Releases Digital Edition of Middle School Science Program
Interactive tablet edition strengthens capabilities of IQWST curriculum
</div>

<p>
    GREENWICH, Conn. - Best described as an "Interactive Science Curriculum & Notebook," <a target="_blank" href="http://sangariglobaled.com/iqwst-tablet-edition">IQWST Interactive Digital Edition (IDE)</a> is the first truly interactive middle school science curriculum for tablets and laptops.  This new edition of the IQWST science curriculum expands the ways in which students are able to engage with science as it incorporates audio, video, graphic simulations, and writing and drawing tools into the already powerful <a target="_blank" href="http://sangariglobaled.com/iqwst">IQWST curriculum</a> .
</p>
<p>
    IQWST (Investigating and Questioning our World through Science and Technology) is a grade 6-8 program designed to engage students in scientific practices as they experience phenomena and investigate science questions. 
</p>
<p>
    <a target="_blank" href="http://sangariglobaled.com/iqwst-tablet-edition-teacher-benefits">Teachers</a> are able to address key science concepts and literacy skills, including both NGSS and the Common Core, as their students read, write, talk, and do science in order to learn the core ideas and crosscutting concepts key to STEM learning.
</p>
<p>
   The Interactive Digital Edition extends what the print version of IQWST can do, enabling students and their teachers to interact with the curriculum in ways that leverage the power of new technologies.
</p>
<p>
    The IQWST program transforms students into scientists. Supported by funding from the National Science Foundation, IQWST was developed over a decade by science education, literacy, and learning science experts from the University of Michigan, Northwestern University, Michigan State University, and the Weizmann Institute of Science. 
</p>
<p>
    Students investigate questions relevant to their lives -"How can I smell things from a distance?" "What's going on inside me?"- by experiencing phenomena, conducting investigations, developing and using scientific models, collecting and interpreting data, and constructing explanations of how and why things happen in the real world.  And now, for the first time, this program is available in a digital, fully interactive format.
</p>
<p>
    "Schools are going ahead with many interesting tablet and digital technology initiatives but there is very little strong curriculum for these new devices. We are proud to be releasing this exciting program.  It is the first truly interactive middle school science curriculum for tablets and other one-to-one devices.  We are also very proud of its strong abilities to address both the Next Generation Science Standards and incorporating the Common Core into science," said Eric Johnson, CEO of Sangari Active Science.
</p>
<p>
	"Our students are so happy to have IQWST available on their tablets," said Kery Obradovich, the K-8 math and science coordinator for Northbrook/Glenview School District 30 in Illinois. "We have always loved using IQWST's investigative curriculum, and this tablet edition will help students use their natural curiosity to research science in an innovative way."
