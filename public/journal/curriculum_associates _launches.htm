    Curriculum Associates Launches New Math App to Help Students Develop Fact Fluency and Computational Fluency
</div>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
<div class="title-4" align="center">
	Door 24&reg; Plus for grades 1–8 joins the i-Ready&reg; mobile family of educational products
</div>

<div class="space"></div>

<p>
   NORTH BILLERICA, Mass. —Curriculum Associates has expanded its i-Ready&reg; Diagnostic & Instruction mobile family of products with the launch of Door 24&reg; Plus, a new educational game for the iPad&reg;. Expanding upon the award-winning Door 24 app and available for free on the App Store, Door 24 Plus establishes a foundation based on fact fluency and then builds computational fluency by providing practice that requires students to solve problems using basic facts, number sense, and algebraic thinking.
</p>
<p> 
	“Harnessing the power of game design, Door 24 Plus offers students an engaging learning experience and targeted skill development to ensure improved outcomes and achievement in math,” said Rob Waldron, CEO of Curriculum Associates. “Complementing i-Ready’s online diagnostic and instructional components, the new app supports both teachers and students in the blended learning environment. By serving up personalized practice in a fun game environment, Door 24 Plus provides a robust resource for students to boost critical skills at school and at home.”
</p>
<p> 
	Door 24 Plus contains two games: Snargg Splatt to develop fact fluency, and Victor Fixer to develop computational fluency. After completing a brief assessment to identify skill gaps and growth areas, the app will assign students to the appropriate game. As an additional benefit to customers, students can now use their i-Ready credentials to sign in to any iPad and continue their gameplay without worrying about using the same device.
</p>
<p> 
	In the Snargg Splatt fact fluency game, students work fast to combat the evil Snargg-nado by completing math facts and throwing balls at the game board before the time runs out. The game develops automaticity with basic math facts in all four operations and provides repeated exposure to math facts via spiral review. Students can also partner up to play the two-player game and work together as they practice their targeted facts.
</p>
<p> 
	In the Victor Fixer computational fluency game, students are introduced to Victor, a robot who went haywire and needs help getting patched up. To repair Victor’s circuits, students use problem-solving strategies to solve equations equivalent to 24. The game develops students’ abilities to think quantitatively and strategically and encourages flexibility and perseverance in solving problems. 
</p>
<p> 
	The app is free and can be downloaded at <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/door-24-plus/id950043113?mt=8">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/door-24-plus/id950043113?mt=8</a> or by searching for “Door 24 Plus” in the App Store.
