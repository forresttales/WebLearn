<p>
    CHANDLER, Ariz. – Schools in Georgia and all around the country are transitioning away from the traditional textbook model. To support that transition, <a target="_blank" href="http://odysseyware.com/">Odysseyware</a> has officially been approved for Georgia’s textbook replacement program. Odysseyware, a leading provider of online, multimedia-enriched K-12 curriculum and blended learning solutions, now has 115 <a target="_blank" href="http://odysseyware.com/course-catalog">core, elective and Career Technical Education (CTE)</a> courses approved by the state to meet Georgia’s academic standards.
</p>
<p>
    “We are thrilled that Georgia has recognized Odysseyware’s potential to help schools move toward a more innovative and environmentally-friendly education model,” said Mike Kirksey, Odysseyware’s Georgia representative.  “What is exciting is not just that the courses are approved based on their quality and alignment to Georgia standards. These courses are dynamic and engaging.
</p>
<p>
    They were designed for 21st century learners and are flexible enough to be used seamlessly in multiple instructional settings.” Following the rigorous review and approval process, Odysseyware now has twice as many courses approved for textbook replacement as the next closest provider. 
</p>
<p>
   “I can honestly say there has never been a better time for Georgia educators to explore what Odysseyware has to offer,” said Kirksey. This approval coincides with the <a target="_blank" href="http://odysseyware.com/school-solutions">largest new product release</a> in Odysseyware’s history, including a new student interface, all new virtual labs, high school test prep courses, prescriptive learning paths, a blended learning library, and assessment and remediation tools. Odysseyware also offers Georgia-specific math courses, as well as a course customization tool to tailor any lesson to a district or school’s individual needs. State funds for textbook replacement can be used to purchase the courses, easing the financial burden on districts.
