    Bridgeport Public Schools<br/> Expands Use of myON

	<p style="font-size: 20px; font-style: italic;">District expanding access to myON’s personalized digital literacy platform </p>
<div class="space"></div>

<p>
    MINNEAPOLIS – Bridgeport Public Schools in Bridgeport, CT, announces the expansion of their partnership with myON, a personalized digital literacy platform providing students online and offline access to over 7,000 authentic digital books. As the second largest district in the state, with 37 schools serving over 21,000 students, Bridgeport Public Schools sought out myON to strengthen their literacy program by better integrating technology into their curriculum and to place more books in the hands of their students.
</p>
<p>
    Last fall, the district began using myON at Luis Munoz Marin School (PK-8) to support their literacy program and to increase the number of books available to students and their families. With access to thousands of books online, students and families were given an instant library to access in school and at home on computers, devices and tablets.  After experiencing success with the platform at Luis Munoz Marin, the district decided to expand their pilot program to offer access to myON’s library to students at Beardsley School (PK-6).
</p>
<p>
    “As Director of Literacy, I am constantly looking for new ways and resources that promote reading and reading engagement with our students,” said Melissa Jenkins, director of literacy for Bridgeport Public schools. “myON’s personalization and customization features provide our students with unique, appropriate digital content aligned to their reading level and interests.  Since its implementation we have seen the platform generate more excitement to read as well as fostering student literacy growth and achievement.”
</p>
<p>
    “Our mission is to increase digital access in our community and to put more books in the hands of our students,” added Fran Rabinowitz, superintendent of Bridgeport Public Schools. “With myON, students are able to access books both in school, where each classroom is equipped with Chromebooks, or at home on their computers, tablets or devices, allowing them to engage in reading wherever they are. In the past three months, students at both Luis Munoz Marin and Beardsley have spent over 750 hours reading and read nearly 3,000 books using myOn. We are very excited about the expansion of myON in our district and we look forward to more of our students gaining access to the platform.”
</p>
<p>
    “At myON, we believe a student’s ability to read and comprehend what they are reading is imperative to a student’s academic success,” stated Todd Brekhus, president of myON.  “We are honored that Bridgeport Public Schools selected myON to provide students with a platform that will encourage students to read and are excited to be a part of their continued success moving forward.”
