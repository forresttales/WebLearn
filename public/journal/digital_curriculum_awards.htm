TOP 10 U.S. SCHOOLS TO WIN AWARDS FOR MOVING TO<br/> DIGITAL CURRICULUM
</div>
<p style="font-style: italic;">The Learning Counsel and T-Mobile honor these schools and districts for advancing digital content in their schools and communities.</p>

<div class="space"></div>

<p>
    The Learning Counsel, a media and events production company focused on research and context on the shift in education to digital curriculum, honored 10 of these schools for their excellence in integrating digital curricula and content into their teaching and learning. Following a survey of hundreds of U.S. K-12 public schools, the Learning Counsel selected the schools based on their strategy elements; digital curriculum tactics and content coverage models; organizational practices and systems; successful shift in teaching; and educator and student technology provisions, training, and active use of digital curriculum.
<br/><br/>
	“With an estimated 50% of students nationwide using some sort of computing device for a significant portion of the school day, more and more schools throughout the nation are using all-digital curriculum and content, but some schools are proving themselves to be head and shoulders above the rest,” said Leilani Cauthen, founder and CEO of the Learning Counsel. 
<br/><br/>
	The organization presented its Award of Excellence for Digital Curriculum & Content Strategy at the annual national conference for education executives at a special ceremony, sponsored by T-Mobile, on November 3. 
<br/><br/>
	Following are the honorees and what they have done at their schools and districts: 
<br/><br/>
	<strong>Grand Winner: Denver Public Schools</strong><br/>
Denver Public Schools (DPS) has created a vision for integrating and using digital curriculum and content into the teaching and learning process at each of its 185 schools. The Denver 2020 plan outlines the use of technology as a key strategy to ensure a high quality learning experience for its students. This strategy allows the district to leverage the curriculum content and data to create highly personalized learning for each of its 87,000 students. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Urban Districts</strong>
<br/><br/>
<strong>1st Place: Houston Independent School District (Texas)</strong>
<br/>
As the eighth largest school district in the U.S., serving approximately 214,000 students, Houston ISD has made tremendous strides in the last two years, implementing its 1:1 “PowerUp” initiative in its high schools. This initiative defines and shapes a plan for personalized learning and a digital transformation that puts computers in the hands of every student beginning in high school, ultimately eliminating print resources for the district’s high schools.  
<br/><br/>
“Not only is HISD being an aggressive leader in using digital curriculum and content, its leaders are playing key roles in national discussions pushing for the adoption of format standards. Their leadership is sparking much discussion around the portability of content in order to allow flexibility in use,” said Cauthen.

<strong>Special Recognition:<br/> Alabama Department of Education’s Learning Exchange Program</strong>
