    HOUSTON – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aldine.k12.tx.us/">Aldine Independent School District</a> (Texas), a former Broad Prize winner, has migrated to <a target="_blank" href="http://schoology.com/">Schoology</a> for managing curriculum, virtual instruction, credit recovery, staff development and other educational initiatives. Schoology will be the core learning management system (LMS) powering many of the district’s education initiatives which focus on meeting individual learner needs so students will get the most from their education. <a target="_blank" href="http://ctt.ec/Mayrb">Click to Tweet.</a>
</p>
<p>
Aldine ISD has been a leader on numerous technology fronts for years. Its Virtual School has been in place since 1996 providing students with distance learning and credit recovery in a TEKS-aligned, project-based online learning environment. 
</p>
<p>
“With Schoology, our instructors can collaboratively create and share content, communicate with students and each other, and manage their courses and students,” said Kiesha Taylor, Aldine ISD coordinator of online learning. “Schoology will be the core application allowing us to meet all of our goals for the Aldine Virtual School as well as other initiatives in our district.” 
</p>
<p>
This one-stop experience is a major justification for selecting Schoology for Aldine’s education initiatives in addition to Aldine Virtual School: distance learning, technology integration including BYOD (bring your own device), district-wide curriculum planning, personal learning communities (plc) and online staff development. 
</p>
<p>
Taylor added, “All the district’s initiatives can flow through Schoology. It streamlines many of our processes, is easy to use and maintain, and provides the integrity we expect so that our students benefit from having the best technology to support their learning needs.”
</p>
<p>
Schoology is a learning management system that enhances schools’ ability to power collaboration, communication and resource sharing. Educators can build media-rich learning communities within Schoology where students share, collaborate and learn together in class and beyond the classroom walls—even from a smartphone.
