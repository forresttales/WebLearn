<p>
    The Learning Counsel interviewed Elad Inbar, CEO of RobotsLAB, Inc. to learn more about their vision for sparking interest in Math with robots.
</p>
<p>
	During the interview, we were fascinated to learn how far the industry has come in delivering pre-packaged solutions for teaching math concepts, 
	including STEM curriculum aligned with TEKS, STAAR and Common Core Standards. You no longer need an engineer in your math or science departments 
	to use the new robotics toolkits to engage students.
</p>
<p>
    RobotsLAB is a group of roboticists, engineers, teachers and professors who have developed an all-in-one tailored set of solutions featuring the industry’s
    best robots, along with custom curriculum that has been teacher vetted so that teachers and students can run exercises and lessons in with a tablet and no
    prior experience with robotics.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>Welcome, Elad, what attracted you to come into this particular field?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar, CEO, RobotsLAB: </strong>I’ve loved robots since I was a child, building robots, playing with them and working with them. For many years robots were
    just toys for geeks, you know. In the past few years I have started to see robots that are super capable, that are ready made that you can use to do
    <img src="../repository/article-sparking-math-2.png" alt="article-sparking-math-2.png" align="right">
    whatever you want. This has basically opened an amazing opportunity to focus on the development side of that, the application side, not just the hardware
    side of it. When you think about it, the software is the important thing. Software is what makes the robot interact with its environment. It’s the software
    together with the hardware that basically helps students learn why they need to learn. It is an incredible opportunity to bring robots to the classroom as
    a teaching aid.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>Walk me through a little bit how schools get involved in a program like this? Is it supplemental? Are they trying to put it in as
    math or science core curriculum, just how are they getting involved?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>With the RobotsLAB BOX kit, what we are doing is actually helping the teachers. We’re not replacing them or creating an entirely different
    curriculum. We are giving teachers the ability to answer the ultimate question – Why? Why do I need to learn that? Things like sine and cosine and so on.
    We’ve developed these lessons where teachers can actually provide students the “why” of their regular and standard courses, and using the robots and
    lessons to demonstrate how these concepts in science or math apply to students' daily lives. In that way we are not creating a new curriculum teachers have
    to learn, we are just bringing robots where teachers can plug them into the lessons that already exist.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>When the school actually decides to do a program with robots, tell me how are they choosing to do this, is it usually a math teacher
    or how does this come about?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>Our major focus is not really a robots lab. What we are doing is targeting math and career and technical directors on the other side, within
    the existing math and science classes. The kit is basically a new set of tools for math instruction, but one that emphasizes engagement and visual
    learning. It’s not like a competition based robots lab, this is something totally different. Everything we do is 100% aligned to standards, and what we are
    doing with that is helping schools bring to life the subjects they already have to teach.
</p>
<p>
    What it is important to understand is that these programs are not like the Legos-type programs and so on. This isn't an extra-curricular activity that
    keeps the students working together after the regular curriculum. Those programs are great but they only help students that are already interested in
    robotics. We want to help every student get better at math and science. This has to take place within existing standard lessons. Doing experiments within
    the things they need to know anyway.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>Have you had those conversations with schools about how robots help them meet the standards and all that?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>Yes, we are working with a large number of teachers as well as with Professor Peter Stone from the Department of Computer Science at the
    University of Texas at Austin. They are the ones telling us what teachers need. What they told us is that too many students are losing their way in math
    around 8th or 9th grade. If kids fall behind in Algebra and equations, well, you know, you lose them forever. So what the teachers have given us as a
    challenge is to help improve the stuff that they find really, really hard to teach, or that the students really struggle with. And all these challenges are
    basically the heart of the common core standards, vectors and up to pre-calc. They gave us a list and we developed a curriculum to teach what was needed
    and make it more engaging and effective for students.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>What are some of the outcomes about what has been going on in classrooms, some of the things that you didn’t expect that maybe
    surprised you?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>Well, you know I am an Israeli, and I started the company in Israel where we worked with the most advanced human robots available. I guess you
    know that whenever you bring a robot into a classroom, kids are like “Wow!” and when you bring a quad-copter into the middle of a classroom you know that
    everyone will be hooked. They are all fully engaged and paying attention. The way we structured the lessons is so that on the learning side of that there
    is a quick competition in the classroom and teacher can introduce challenges and the groups can provide their answer by actually controlling the robot. So
    there is an engagement method there, and that was what I expected. What I didn’t expect was the level of engagement. We have schools actually using the
    robots with project-based learning, the whole flipped classroom where they give these robots to the students and they have to figure out particular
    concepts themselves and then explain them to teachers later on. What we didn’t expect was how kids came up with new things, new lessons themselves, new
    <img src="../repository/article-sparking-math-3.png" alt="article-sparking-math-3.png" align="right">    
    concepts, using the robots to teach themselves math. This was way beyond our expectations.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>Most schools complain about having no money, is that what do you run into, or what’s the real barrier to jumping in to using robots?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>Money is always an issue but not as much as a hurdle as you might think. It depends mostly on a teacher or administrator who knows their way
    around the budget. When California had such a budget crisis, in fact much of the fund was simply moved to after-school programs, and we were selling to those programs for 
    those years. In other places, we explained that whole program was so simple that teachers only had to swipe their finger (on the tablet provided), and the software was so 
    simple that it was interactive just with that. You’ve seen the demo at a conference, so you know that my goal is to make
    it so that just with a tablet you have instant interaction with a robot, and to keep it really just as simple as you would have in swiping a tablet. In
    many instances, simpler. So we’ve created a very simple set of controls so that you can pull down with your finger and the robot will move accordingly, and
    it depends on the lesson if it’s the ankle on the robot or the speed it’s moving or the ratio, etc. You don’t need any prior experience with robotics to
    know what you’re running.

<br/>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>As the Learning Counsel, we’re speaking from the viewpoint of schools having a strategy – so one of the questions that will come
    about this is that when you’re providing one of the kits, any one of your kits, is the software capable of being embedded into a learning management
    system? You know their repository systems, so that other teachers can pull each other’s lessons and content so on – are your lessons going to fit into
    that?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>Well yes and no. We built it (the software) in such a way that it’s pretty contained in itself, together with the hardware in the transport
    case that it comes in. But, also the whole thing is very flexible, allowing for the kit to move from a physics classroom to geometry classroom to
    pre-calculus and so forth so that teachers can share it. It’s not like online shared curriculum, it’s all contained, but many teachers usually share in a
    whole school.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>So, let’s say we open one of the kits – is there a piece of software that lands on a computer like a thick-client?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>No, we send an Android tablet that is pre-loaded with all the lessons and all the quizzes and all the instructional materials and the training
    for the teachers and all that – everything is ready and goes with the kit.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>All right, let’s say they have the one tablet – can they pull the software out of there and share it around?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>We provide a DVD with all the lessons and quiz answers as part of the kit. We have videos per lesson that help train the teachers on how to
    deliver, and a teacher’s book with all the lesson plans and screen shots. It’s all on the tablet and on the DVD in case they want to print it. We’re also
    working on an online version of that so pretty soon everything will be in a model so teachers can put them into student’s virtual backpacks and let them
    run with it. That’s an important development that will be integrated with the way teachers are actually teaching today.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>How about the testing? Let’s say the teachers are using these quizzes, is there a way to export the results of those so that teachers
    can make records into the central management systems of the schools?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>Right now it’s basically a PDF that teachers can use, but that’s changing because all the quizzes will be available in that model online with
    the score sheets and graphs and progress online and all that.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>Okay – I think I get it. So what grade levels do you find yourself selling into the most?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>Primarily middle and high school, as our content starts from Algebra 1 and we cover all the way up to Pre-Calculus. On top of that, however, we
    do have some elementary school lessons for those schools that want to demonstrate relationships of certain things so that later on the higher level
    concepts will click with kids because they’ve been exposed to lower level concepts.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>Do you find this going into all different types of schools or what? Really just high income schools, or low income schools, or pretty
    all over the map?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>It’s all over the map. We have Advanced Placement Algebra teachers and then some teachers in the most struggling neighborhoods. For example in
    one school when I walked in there, I heard babies crying. There was a daycare in the school, and it was the student’s babies. A low-income school. You see,
    the beauty of our kits is that we see robots touching every type of student because they are so visual and they bring to life these interesting concepts.
</p>
<p>
    For example, you could give a 30-minute lecture on how to use a screwdriver, including how much force you apply, the vectors of rotation, when to stop it
    and so on, talk about all those mathematics concepts behind it; or, I could just take a screwdriver and show you how to do it. That’s what we’re doing with
    robots, we’re demonstrating things like vectors and bringing them to life so that everyone can understand. It doesn’t’ matter if they are AP students, or
    kids that are really struggling -- it touches everyone in a way that is almost an intuitive way to grasp, by seeing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>You mean by mimicking, seeing the mass of something…
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>
    Exactly, seeing something abstract come to reality is critical because so much of our brains are wired to learn visually. You know, we didn’t
    have abstract thinking for millions of years, humans didn’t, and now we are trying to teach ourselves at a very young age these hugely abstract concepts
    now. Robots really help with that.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>Let me just see what else I need to ask you. So typically you can fit your lessons into either core curriculum, supplemental or
    elective?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>Exactly. It really depends on how the school manages their budget or where they see the need.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>When you are engaging with a school what is the variable price point to get into a robotics program – from what dollar figure up to
    what?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>Entry level is about $3500 and includes everything, four robots and all the accompany curriculum. There's also a deluxe version with a year’s
    subscription for additional lessons, because each time we finish lessons we release those out to our whole community. The deluxe version also offers a
    comprehensive warranty so that if something happens, just give us a call and we send a replacement. Honestly, everyone gets the deluxe kits for the peace
    of mind, it’s worth the extra $500.

<br/>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>So there is not a recurring cost?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>Well, so the second year, if they want to renew the warranty or renew the subscription for the additional lessons that’s also possible.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>What about the more expensive kits, can it go way up in cost?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>We do offer other robots and some of them are more expensive. The Nao robot, for example, can cost up to $18,000 by itself or about $18,500
    with an accompanying curriculum. If a school wants a bigger program the cost can go up but it doesn’t have to.

<br/>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>Is the software all proprietary on the Android, or open-source or what?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>It’s not really open-source. We developed the whole thing. We worked really, really hard and invested a lot of resources to make it happen. Our
    curriculum is what makes our robots so great.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>Okay, I think I’m a fan of that for beginner programs because it’s allowing teachers to not have to do everything and code
    themselves, but have people asked you to open up the code so that kids could learn to program in it?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>Actually yes, and this sparked a new program curriculum that we are working on, which is a computer science program designed to teach students
    how to program the robots directly. This is an independent curriculum on top of the same hardware.
</p>
<p>
    In this specific set up that we are currently introduced into the market, teachers and students don’t need to program ever, but can focus on the math side
    of it, because let’s face it, the kids who’ve made it all the way up to already programming in Java, I’m not worried about their success. The problem is
    with the students who need to understand why they even need to learn math.
</p>
<p>
    This is our focus, this is why we are even looking at making it as simple as possible for the teachers and for the students as well.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>I’m glad you enjoy what you’re doing, you sound so passionate about it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>Yeah I really love it, especially since this is great for students. Even if a student becomes a marketing manager when they grow up, they still
    need math and being able to work on things like marketing predictions and present equations on findings. If they can do basic algebra, they can get along.
    Pretty much everything today requires higher math and U.S. schools know that they need to do better on math scores.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>One final thing, what’s your prediction for the future, do you think it will go towards allowing really advanced kids to go from the
    coding conception and building of robots on up, or do you think it will be going in the direction of more and more of a paved road and that’s what most
    people will be wanting?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Elad Inbar: </strong>In a way, we are tapping into both those directions, especially under the math program. For me, I just think that robots are amazing tools
    because students love to work with them and love to control them, it just gives them that ability. I mean, think of yourself as a child, you have zero
    effect on your life, everyone tells you when to wake up, when to go to school, when to do your homework, when to go to sleep. I mean you can’t do anything,
    and then robotics comes to your school and you are the master. The combination of excitement, control and visual learning is what makes the light bulbs go
    off with these kids. For me, this is why I really, really love robots for kids. Being able to bring math and science lessons to life and also teaching them
    something while they are playing and working with robots, this is really a great opportunity.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Learning Counsel: </strong>Thank you Elad!
