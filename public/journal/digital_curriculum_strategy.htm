<p>
    Many schools have a technology plan. It was extremely popular to have lengthy and involved plans written and rendered into beautiful powerpoint about five
    years ago. It seems like shortly thereafter the speed of change picked up to such a degree that it is difficult to find a current complete plan in many
    districts.
</p>
<p>
    With the advent of so many 1:1 tablets, school IT and curriculum staff have been overwhelmed with roll-outs. The transition to teaching digitally is well
    under way. Even so, most schools are operating with a loose tech plan that is constantly changing and no real digital content and curriculum plan.
</p>
<p>
    The two types of plans are not mutually exclusive. Yet without a complete content and curriculum plan, many of the tech plans are falling on their heads.
</p>
<p>
    It’s important to briefly describe what a Digital Curriculum Strategy would look like, and start with what it is <em>not</em>.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            It’s not a device roll-out plan.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            It’s not a network upgrade plan.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            It’s not a limited set of apps or subscriptions, which would be mere tactics.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Before we talk strategy, let’s look at where we’ve been on the subject of curriculum. For perhaps 80 years schools have relied on textbooks and libraries
    as the foundation of lesson plans. Workbooks complimented textbooks and provided a streamlined set of tactics by subject. Video and streaming TV augmented
    these. Later subscription services for libraries of lesson plans came into play.
</p>
<p>
    For the breadth of this time most schools relied on a handful of Publishers. School Boards had as a main duty the vetting of textbooks. They and the
    Superintendent and immediate staff would do large deals to buy large quantities of things from a few. Then came the digital age and almost before we knew
    it, there were far too many things and companies to vet. The “system” of selection and vetting in large part has devolved to the individual teacher with
    some remnants of overlay still in place for some materials being driven from management down to the troops. This took what was a fairly clear and clean
    strategy to a non-strategy in most places. This non-strategy is enormously expensive to the system, though largely unseen in the excitement to go digital.
</p>
<p>
    A Strategy could look something like this:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Create a Goal</strong>
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    This is from the viewpoint of digital curriculum, both as a known objective and as something towards which actions are directed with the purpose of
    achieving some end. <strong>For most schools this will be a smooth transition or upgrade.</strong> It should not, in its thinking, be divorced from the
    platform or the mix of access. The choice of platform should be <em>dependent</em> on the curriculum, not the reverse. If you go the reverse route you may
    end up with the more expensive route on curriculum – wait for it to be built, build it yourself, or scramble around to knit a decent portfolio together.
    The mix of access could determine a great deal of the structure you’ll need in curriculum. For purposes of communicating to management and staff, the
    statement of the Goal could be fairly long and short statements of the Plans, Programs and Projects that branch off of it.
</p>
<ol start="2">
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Establish Purposes</strong>
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    This is a lesser goal expressing future intentions. It’s important to write it down and get it agreed upon. A purpose may aim at determining what
    pedagogical learning theory will the district lean on for what grades, and what subjects. It may answer if that theory will it be a universal for the
    institution or more as-appropriate. As a purpose it may seek to create some continuity across a district for the sake of cost savings as an intention.
</p>
<p>
    An example of a Purpose might be: “The (Name your District) will adopt digital curriculum is to ensure a prevailing digital component to every important
    aspect of teaching and learning in every subject at every grade.” The operative word here would be <em>prevailing</em>.
</p>
<ol start="3">
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Set policy</strong>
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    This may start with a survey of any existing school or district instructional and curriculum policies. These may include the instructional theories in use
    and any shift in intention, institution and staff policies. It’s important to do this because some of the pedagogy is going to shift and you’ll be able to
    know who is used to doing what.
</p>
<ol start="4">
    <li>
        <p>
            <strong>Make a Plan</strong>
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    A plan is really a short-range broad intention for handling a broad area and will have broad steps. To have a <em>good</em> plan, it’s best to start with
    these two steps, and then write up the plan, which will have programs and projects.
</p>
<ol>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Assess the System of Instruction </strong>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
</ol>
<p>
    How and what are teachers teaching with <em>now</em>. Are they using the thousands of whiteboards invested in already? If so, this may dictate certain
    types of curriculum and interaction with tablets that will set up lesson plans.
</p>
<p>
    Do they run a lot of projects that will require collaboration tools?
</p>
<p>
    Are they primarily lecturing so lecture capture could be useful to go to a flipped-classroom model?
</p>
<p>
    There’s a lot of other questions to ask here that will formulate a curriculum strategy, not the least of which is to ask the teacher directly:
</p>
<p>
    Have they already found some digital curriculum that will fit their subject? Assessed the lesson-time used? Is it core or supplemental only? What about
    special needs? What if they have to teach dually – part on tablets and part on paper because some parents won’t allow kids to have a tablet?
</p>
<p>
    Do they have questions and input?
</p>
<ol>
    <ol start="2" type="a">
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Build an Implementation timeline</strong>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
</ol>
<p>
    This is not going to be as quick as everyone would like, but you can set up a strategy with sub-tactics and distribute them out to groups. Some sub-tactics
    such as a consultant to flank the work of all groups to consider special needs, testing requirements, remote access, and more can be set up if you don’t
    have some of those smarts in-house.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Under the Plan – Write the Programs</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Underneath the plan will branch off individual Programs, which can be distributed out to others or small groups. A Program is a series of steps in sequence
    to carry out the bigger overall plan. Here is a short list of potential programs. Some have further notes for purposes of this article.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Possible Programs</strong>
</p>
<ol type="A">
    <li>
        <p>
            Assess Initial Resources
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    First take inventory of everything you own. You probably won’t be able to figure out whether very much of it meets Standards on your own, but some of it
    might. This is a lengthy process. (Hint: the Learning Counsel is trying to automate this process for free to schools with EdMatchUp, coming soon.)
</p>
<p>
    When taking inventory, give a briefing as to what all you are looking for including lesson plans, apps, subscriptions, video, lists some teacher made of
    cool sites to visit for a subject, everything.
</p>
<p>
    Ask around as to who in your district or school has any instructional design background. This can be useful for making up digital curriculum either on your
    own or using a service.
</p>
<p>
    Next you need to assess without bias what’s in the market for purchase or free. An obvious point is also to assess whether free is actually free or will
    run into issues such as out-of-date, must be maintained, will cost to build mobility into, etc. Consultants like The Learning Counsel can advise on all the
    sources including the nationally known big publishers, the new “born-digital” publishers, app developers, commercial app sources, online content libraries,
    government curriculum sites, professional development digital curriculum, build-your-own tools, productivity and creativity tools, and more.
</p>
<p>
    Next you need to tag back to what sort of storage and management the district or school has in the way of Learning Management Systems and Student
    Information Systems. It may be that what you already own doesn’t provide the APIs (application interfaces) that will allow you to port in something else
    you really want to use, which will make it all messy to access that particular digital curriculum. Or you have decided on a lot of subscription services
    that are not going to require teachers to remember 25 or more different passwords.
</p>
<ol start="2" type="A">
    <li>
        <p>
            Getting Coverage for Every Standard
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Getting Testing all Digital
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Reducing Cost Structure
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Filling Gaps
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    You could run or distribute several Projects under this program. A project is a sequence of steps to complete one part of a program. One project might be
    getting a firm understanding of lesson-time used in known digital curriculum already in existence, and the overall need for any one subject. This would be
    an extension of inventory taking and shows up gaps. Another project might be to custom build a piece of digital curriculum and build a lesson plan around
    it. A project like this could involve hiring instructional designers and having to know what to ask them about their capabilities.
</p>
<ol start="6" type="A">
    <li>
        <p>
            Security and Access Issues
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Inventory and Renewals Management
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<ol start="8" type="A">
    <li>
        <p>
            Aquire Initial Resources
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    A good idea would be to take a look at what other schools are doing with their bids. There are more than 700 companies to assess and literally thousands of
    resource sites.
</p>
<ol start="9" type="A">
    <li>
        <p>
            Professional Development, Practice &amp; Pilot
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Annual monitoring and reassessment
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Hey, you’re not done yet! Next, a good Strategy for Digital Curriculum would state its Ideal Scene. It should actually have one that crosses with the IT
    side. Maybe an ideal scene would be every student grades 9-12 has a completely mobile and personalized curriculum.
</p>
<p>
    Then there’s Statistics. Don’t forget that you need to run number of Projects completed, number of Programs completed and write up how you met the Plan by
    what date and got to the Goal.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, what is the final product? Has it created something tangible and great for the students and teachers?
</p>
<p>
    Once you work out a real strategy, you can expect minimal updates and some repeat projects every year.
