    Denver, CO – Aegis Identity Software, Inc. a leading provider of Identity and Access Management solutions for the Education marketplace, announced their signature of the Student Privacy Pledge led by the Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) and the Software & Information Industry Association (SIIA).
</p>
<p>
    “Aegis Identity Software, Inc. proudly stands with students, parents, educators, school leaders, and the public on protecting students by ensuring their data is only used for approved educational purposes by district authorized people and systems. We have built an enterprise-class software platform designed to manage digital identities in both the higher education and K12 education marketplaces and we are committed to protecting the privacy and identity management of all students,” states Jat Pannu, Chief Strategy Officer, Aegis Identity Software. 
</p>
<p>
    “Our company is Denver based with a proven reputation in the identity management market throughout North America.  Protecting student privacy and their data is of the utmost importance to Aegis Identity Software and we are proud to join the other thought leaders in the industry that have signed the Pledge. Our goal and commitment is together we will make a difference in this arena to ensure that all student data is private and used only for educational purposes.”
</p>
<p>
    The Pledge was developed by the FPF and SIIA with guidance from the school services providers, educator organizations, and other stakeholders following a convening by U.S. Representatives Jared Polis (CO) and Luke Messer (IN). The Student Privacy Pledge is based on principles regarding the collection, maintenance and use of students’ personal information. The pledge would apply to all student personal information, whether or not it is viewed as part of an "educational record" as defined by federal law, and whether it has been collected and controlled by the school but warehoused offsite by a service provider, or collected directly through students’ use of a mobile app or website assigned by a teacher. The pledge would also apply to school service providers whether or not they have a formal contract with the school.
</p>
<p>
    In today’s increasingly interconnected world, American companies are also leaders in protecting privacy, taking unprecedented steps to invest in cybersecurity and provide customers with precise control over the privacy of their online content.  Aegis Identity Software has committed to this cause by signing the Student Privacy Pledge to provide parents, teachers, and students with important protections against misuse of their data.
