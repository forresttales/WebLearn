<p>
    BEAVERTON, Oregon, May 1, 2014 – This summer, Vernier Software &amp; Technology will offer more than 20 full-day, hands-on training institutes to help
    science and STEM teachers integrate data-collection technology into their science curriculum. Educators can select from either general or subject-specific
    institutes, during which they will work alongside a training specialist and use Vernier’s award-winning line of hardware and software technology to explore
    classroom-ready experiments and activities.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="h.30j0zll"></a>
    “Our Summer Institutes provide a great professional development opportunity for educators who are looking to increase their use of data-collection and
    analysis in the classroom as called for in the Next Generation Science Standards,” said David Vernier, co-founder of Vernier and a former physics teacher.
    “The hands-on training and guidance from our specialists allow participants to learn new and innovative teaching techniques that they can then use with
    their students.”
</p>
<p>
    The general, full-day institutes are designed to meet the needs of teachers from a wide variety of grade levels and STEM disciplines, including physics,
    chemistry, biology, environmental/Earth science, middle school science, and more. In addition to the training, each participating teacher will receive a
    Workshop Training Manual on CD, a Vernier lab book or $50 gift certificate, and more.
</p>
<p>
    The workshops additionally offer attendees the option of earning two (quarter) Graduate Science credit hours through the Portland State University Center
    for Science Education.
