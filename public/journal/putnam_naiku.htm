<p>
	(EDINA, MN) – <a target="_blank" href="http://www.naiku.net/">Naiku</a>, provider of award-winning, next-generation classroom assessment software, announced today that the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pcsstn.com/pages/Putnam_County_SchoolSystem">Putnam County School System</a> (PCSS) has chosen Naiku’s next-gen assessment software for district-wide implementation.
</p>
<p>
    Based in Cookeville, TN, PCSS serves nearly 11,000 students and has developed their own benchmark assessments in reading and math. The district is moving towards 1:1 device access for their students which gives teachers the flexibility to assess students when they need to, ultimately giving them immediate knowledge about student proficiency for informed instruction.  The district chose Naiku as its assessment platform in part because of how easily their teachers could use their existing tests to view student performance.
</p>
<p>
    “We love that our teachers can quickly measure and track student performance using our existing assessments in Naiku,” said Denette Kolbe, assistant director of schools.  “We were looking for an online assessment system that we could use with our existing district-created benchmark tests and were very pleased with Naiku’s ease of use and the insight it provides us.”
</p>
<p>
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.naiku.net">Naiku‘s cloud-based software</a> is used by schools and districts to quickly measure and track each student’s proficiency of standards in any subject and grade, and is used by individual teachers as well as by groups of teachers with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.naiku.net/benefits/#collaborate">common assessments.</a> Naiku can be used to deliver existing assessments in a wide variety of formats, including Word, PDF, ExamView, TestGen and more. Additionally, teachers and district staff can create and share their own questions and tests with the platform’s built-in test generator.
</p>
<p>
	“While we started looking for a digital assessment solution that could help us with our benchmark assessments, we were pleasantly surprised at how comprehensive Naiku is and felt it could benefit all of our teachers and students on an everyday basis,” added Kolbe.<br/><br/>
	“We’re excited to be partnering with Putnam County,” said Greg Wright, CEO of Naiku.  “It is clear that PCSS has a strong vision for how they are using assessment to impact teaching and learning and to help students.  We’re glad to help them achieve that vision.”
