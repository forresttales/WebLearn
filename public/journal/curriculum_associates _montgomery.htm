<p>
   NORTH BILLERICA, Mass., 2015—Curriculum Associates has partnered with Montgomery County Schools (MCS) in Troy, NC to help the district improve student achievement through the implementation of a new development program funded by a three-year Investing in Innovation (i3) Fund grant from the U.S. Department of Education. Curriculum Associates’ <a target="_blank" href="http://www.i-ready.com/">i-Ready&reg; Diagnostic &amp; Instruction</a> online program for reading and mathematics will be a part of the district’s new A Culture Creating Effective Systems for Success (ACCESS) program, which was designed to create a district-wide culture of technology-based education. 
 </p>
<p>
ACCESS will provide the rural district with high-quality teaching and learning resources that can be accessed anytime, anywhere; expand the reach of effective teachers through connected teaching, instructional redesign and professional learning; and, create a process for teachers and students to readily access assessment data to improve instruction and monitor student progress. With the recently awarded $3.5 million grant, and support through its partnerships with education companies and local organizations, MCS will implement the ACCESS program and provide students with more technology-enabled tools to use in school and at home, including computers for each of its middle and high school students and i-Ready. 
 </p>
<p>
“The leadership team at MCS understands the power of edtech in the teaching and learning process,” said Rob Waldron, CEO of Curriculum Associates. “Being a recipient of the i3 grant is a great accomplishment for the district and further underscores its dedication to providing the resources needed to help all students and teachers succeed. We look forward to our ongoing partnership with MCS as they implement a best practice program that can be replicated by other districts across the country.”
 </p>
<p>
Built for the Common Core, i-Ready combines a valid and reliable measure and personalized instruction in a single online product. The adaptive diagnostic for grades K–12 pinpoints student needs down to the sub-skill level and generates a combination of online instruction for grades K–8 and downloadable teacher-led lessons that are unique to each student’s diagnostic result, in addition to providing targeted skill instruction support through mobile apps. These individualized instructional plans are easy to understand, differentiate instruction, and support a blended learning solution.
</p>
<p>
i-Ready is one of the few programs on the market that can provide districts with a single solution and highly valid and reliable measure to monitor growth and predict student proficiency on a Common Core assessment, in addition to providing personalized instruction throughout a student’s K–12 experience.
