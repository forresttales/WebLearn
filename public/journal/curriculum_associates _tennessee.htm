<p>
   NORTH BILLERICA, Mass., 2015—Curriculum Associates’ Ready&reg; TNCore Mathematics for grades K–8 was recently selected by the State Textbook and Instructional Materials Quality Commission as an approved instructional program for Tennessee schools. The Commission recommended the program based on its focus, rigor, alignment, coherence, usability, and sensitivity after a rigorous review. 
 </p>
<p>
According to the Tennessee Department of Education’s website, the reviews of programs recommended by the State Textbook and Instructional Materials Quality Commission for inclusion on the Official List of Textbooks and Instructional Materials were prepared by committees of classroom teachers and other experts (state advisory panels) and approved by the Commission. The reviews were conducted for the two-fold purpose of assisting the Commission in formulating the official list and assisting local adoption committees in selecting the textbook programs which best meet their local needs.
 </p>
<p>
“Using a research-based and proven-effective model, Ready TNCore was built true to the details and intent of Tennessee’s mathematics standards,” said Rob Waldron, CEO of Curriculum Associates. “The approval of our program reinforces the impact of Ready TNCore as part of the teaching and learning process in helping to effectively improve student outcomes and achievement across key areas of math.” 
 </p>
<p>
The Ready TNCore program addresses the emphasis on conceptual understanding through reasoning, modeling, and discussion that explores the structure of mathematics. The student lessons lay a foundation of conceptual understanding of the mathematical principles underlying the skills addressed while also developing students’ procedural fluency.
</p>
<p> 
As part of the grades K–2 section of the review, the Commission stated, “Math problems are presented in real-world context and each lesson includes a real-world connection. The Common Core Performance Task is scaffolded and also encourages students to apply what they know.”
