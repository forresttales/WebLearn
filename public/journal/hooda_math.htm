<p>
    (MINNEAPOLIS, MINN) March 2014 – Hooda Math, K12’s leading resource for completely free, web based math games announces the release of more than 50
    non-flash based educational games. The 50+ mobile games can be accessed safely through any browser, from any device, along with the more than 500 web based
    games at <a href="http://www.hoodamath.com">www.hoodamath.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Every game offered by Hooda Math is absolutely free, including the newly released mobile games and makes correlations between standards and skills
    practiced in a game.
</p>
<p>
    “As a middle school math teacher, I realized that my students needed more than a textbook or curriculum to stay engaged and improve in math. 5 years ago,
    Hooda Math was born as a completely free, web-based educational gaming site. Today we see more than 3,000,000 visitors each month,” said Michael Edlavitch,
    founder and CEO of Hooda Math. “However, in recent years, BYOD, BYOT and 1:1 initiatives have changed the game, Hooda Math is adapting to meet learners
    where they are, no matter what device they are using.”
</p>
<p>
    Each of the newly released mobile games are non-flash based and compatible with any web-enabled device. Student favorites like <a href="http://www.hoodamath.com/mobile/games/hoodastacker.html">Hooda Stacker</a>, <a href="http://www.hoodamath.com/mobile/games/hoodadissection.html">Hooda Dissection</a> and <a href="http://www.hoodamath.com/mobile/games/hoodaremover.html">Hooda Remover</a> were among the first games to be created specifically for mobile
    platforms.
</p>
<p>
    The shift to mobile is already proving to be beneficial for students – this past December alone, just three months after the site began offering mobile
    games, nearly one million kids played Hooda Math games from their iPads, Kindle Fires, Android tablets and more.
</p>
<p>
    “Teachers have enough on their plates, worrying about whether or not they can get an app installed on devices their students are using shouldn’t be one of
    them,” adds Edlavitch. “We take a lot of pride in being a reliable, trustworthy, educational and safe resource for teachers and parents to further engage
    their students in math, anything we can do to make their lives easier is top priority. Students accessing our math games from their tablets’ browser are
    automatically routed to our mobile site.”
</p>
<p>
    Hooda Math releases new, free, math games on a weekly basis, from basic skill practice to brain-challenging escape games, a favorite among older students
visiting the site. Edlavitch is committed to keeping every game on Hooda Math completely free, visit them at    <a href="http://www.hoodamath.com">www.hoodamath.com</a> and see which games may be perfect for your students, no matter what device they are using.
