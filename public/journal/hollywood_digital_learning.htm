    Hollywood Meets Digital Learning

<p>
    February, 2015 — The Learning Counsel visited Compass Learning in Austin, Texas, while visiting for the Texas Computer Education Association (TCEA) Annual Conference. During the visit our CEO, LeiLani Cauthen had the rare chance to tour behind the scenes in one of the digital curriculum publisher’s headquarters to see what it takes to create multi-dimensional digital resources that reach today’s students. “Seeing what it takes to create highly engaging digital content was exciting and inspiring,” stated LeiLani. “We felt a bit like curriculum-has-gone-Hollywood while we were there, in a constructive sense, using highly engaging audio and visual techniques to reach learners in ways that they are used to, and probably expect, given today’s media-rich world.”  
</p>
<p> 
Beginning with introductions in front of Compass Learning’s three-dimensional school bus, the tour then visited their headquarters’ content creators, digital artists, audio and video engineers.  Part of the visit showcased their fully functioning recording studio as well as video studio complete with green screen. During the tour, the Compass Learning team presented a glimpse of how they bring vital educational tools to teachers, parents and students. The tour, as you can see in the video, proved that Compass Learning looked deeply at what modality was needed to reach young learners and they developed a high-value production system to deliver what is needed. 
</p>
<p>
The Learning Counsel will be looking for more opportunities to showcase behind-the-scenes creative and useful software utility for the new digital resources coming into the education resources market from thousands of companies.
