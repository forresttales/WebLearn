	<em>District to support teachers and administrators through collaborative professional development based on fair and reliable teacher evaluations</em>
</div>

<div class="space"></div>

<p>
    SAN FRANCISCO, May 2014 – Calcasieu Parish School System (CPSS) in Lake Charles, LA has selected Teachscape to support the increased effectiveness of
    teachers and administrators in its 21 priority schools, those designated as high-need. CPSS, the fifth largest district in the state, will help educators
    at these schools engage in collaborative professional learning based on instructional data collected during teacher evaluations. To ensure that these
    evaluations are fair and reliable, 70 administrators will be trained and assessed on Charlotte Danielson’s Framework for Teaching (FFT).
</p>
<p>
    “Evaluations are critical to improving teaching outcomes, and ultimately the achievement of our students,” said Lauren Beckham, project coordinator for The
    PROGRESS Project, which provides support resources for the district’s priority schools. “To make sure the evaluation process is both fair and effective, we
    have to ensure that observers are seeing teaching practice through a common lens using the FFT and then using the instructional data collected to
    personalize the professional learning process for teachers. Teachscape will be a valuable resource for us throughout this multi-faceted process.”
</p>
<p>
    Teachscape will be used as part of the district’s Compass evaluation system, which is designed to provide all educators with regular, meaningful feedback
on their performance, as well as professional development support aligned to educators needs to foster continuous improvement. Using the Teachscape    <em>Focus </em>Observation Training and Assessment System, administrators will be able to conduct evaluations based on the FFT. Outcomes from evaluations
    will inform teachers’ ongoing professional learning that will be enriched using the comprehensive, research-based professional development resources in the
    Teachscape <em>Learn </em>Professional Learning System. This process will provide the foundation for improving teaching practice uniformly across the
    district’s priority schools.
</p>
<p>
    CPSS joins Jefferson Parish Public School System, which is the largest school district in Louisiana, and St. Bernard Parish Public Schools, as the latest
    district in Louisiana to choose Teachscape to help support increased teacher effectiveness.
