    Mac to School Drastically Increases Capacity for Summer Device Buy-Backs 
</div>
<div style="height: 20px;"></div>
	<p style="font-size: 20px; font-style: italic;">Leading Certified Apple Provider moves in to new facility to account for increased device buy-back this summer</p>
<div class="space"></div>

<p>
    SAN JOSE, CA - Summer is an incredibly busy time of year for school and district technology departments, who use the time to inventory existing technology, purchase new devices for the upcoming school year, and decide what to do with existing devices.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mactoschool.com/">Mac to School</a>, the award-winning provider of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mactoschool.com/buy.html">certified Apple devices</a> to the education marketplace, is thrilled to announce the expansion of its headquarters, which will allow their team to process and service <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mactoschool.com/sell.html">more devices purchased from schools</a>, ensuring each is ready to head back to the classroom.
</p>
<p>
Mac to School works with technology teams across the country to put the best technology at the lowest cost into the hands of students.  Summer is an extremely busy time of year, as technology departments are looking to get the most out of the technology they have when looking to sell.
</p>
<p>
“We love education and Apple technology.  We’re committed to our mission of purchasing $10 million in inventory back from schools and districts in 2015,” stated Mac to School Co-Founder and CEO Robert Baker.  “In order to service the volume of devices we are purchasing, we needed more space.  On any given week in the summer we intake multiple thousands of devices.”
</p>
<p>
Their top priority is to keep as many of these devices in education as possible.  Once these devices have been purchased back from schools, Mac to School services and certifies each device with a comprehensive warranty so it is ready to be used in the classroom once again. 
</p>
<p>
“Our new facility is three times the size of our previous headquarters and allows our team to employ the latest generation of device audit and imaging systems,” said Baker.  “This will allow us to provide technology teams with a buy-back quote much faster than before, as well as minimize turnaround time on each device.  Sticking to our green roots, our new facility will allow us to drastically reduce our carbon footprint while expanding our capabilities.” 
</p>
<p>
Administrators across the country have found that selling their Apple devices back to Mac to School is the easiest way to get the most out of their existing technology, as the funds can be used wherever they are needed.  
</p>
<p>
Mac to School makes it a top priority to keep each machine they recertify in education, whether they are made available for purchase at a lower cost or donated through their <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mactoschool.com/give.html">Give Mac program</a>.
